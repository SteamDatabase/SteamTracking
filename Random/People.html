												Scott began playing and designing games at an early age on an Atari 800 and never looked back. He came to Valve after creating games at Legend Entertainment for many years. Aside from level design and game mechanics, he delights in creating particle effects and programming the system that drives them. When not making worlds come to life, he's usually making them explode, bleed, and burn.  He helped to spin up the hardware teams at Valve and currently is working on the Steam Controller.											</p>

Sergiy specializes in systems programming, physics, and applied math. According to him, some games pretend to be simulating physicsy-looking motion. Sergiy made the physics engine behind Uncharted: Drake's Fortune while at Naughty Dog, and the animation system in Far Cry during his lazy years at Crytek. There were a few other odd jobs here and there, but the list is long and boring, and mostly lost in the eons that have passed.											</p>

												I'm a communications nerd and slightly obsessed with all things communications-related, which some might call PR and Marketing. I prefer to say the longer thing which is that I'm literally always delighted to collaborate on working on communications goals and challenges of any kind by finding interesting and thoughtful ways to connect the messaging with different audiences. (My favorite thing in the world is if someone sends me an entire packet of words and says "can we make this better?" It's like a word puzzle, which is a convenient excuse for me to bring up that I'm also a midlevel (ok fine, low-level) jigsaw puzzle competitor.)Prior to joining Valve, I spent twenty years in live TV and radio, doing everything from anchoring the (often depressing) morning news to interviewing guests and putting together stories in ways that I hoped drew attention in fun and interesting ways to the people and organizations that needed it. Did that include cool things like flying with the National Guard and Blue Angels? Yes! Did it also include washing a cow for the county fair? You betcha. Did I ever read the wrong name in the prompter WHILE INTRODUCING MYSELF anchoring the morning show? Of course not*, that's from a movie. *Lies, I totally did that. I was filling in for someone who was out sick and they forgot to change it in the script and it was 4:30am and I was tired and honestly even typing this out I realize I have no excuse.											</p>

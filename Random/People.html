												Bronwen Grimes is half-artist, half-programmer and has been making video games since 2002. She enjoys being part of the tight-knit technical art community, a small (but growing) collection of other artist-programmers who work in games. Growing up in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, she had an idyllic science nerd childhood. Her first experience with programming happened during a summer camp at Carleton University, where kids also got to synthesize nylon, extract cow DNA, and do the time warp again. Although Bronwen has a diploma in Digital Media Arts from Seneca College, she would say her education was mostly self-designed. She has taken classes in art, programming, and math from a half-dozen different schools to suit her unusual discipline. If she had to describe her specialty, it would be "look developer," but her daily tasks fall along a wide spectrum including UI programming, character modeling, and tools programming.											</p>

For the next 12 years he served as Lead Designer at 3DO and Double Fine Productions. Finally, in 2010, he dragged his wife up to the Pacific Northwest and took a job at Valve.											</p>

												Tom graduated from the University of California-Berkeley with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Like most software engineers at the time, he decided to join an Internet startup and become a millionaire before turning 30. When that didn’t happen, and after the Internet bubble burst, he decided to forget all that web-based, e-commerce stuff and pursue his real dream: making video games. He joined Midway Games West (formerly, the original Atari). That studio shut down a few months later, so Tom moved on to Maxis where he worked on titles such as Darkspore, Spore, and The Sims 2 (and many of its expansion packs). Since joining Valve in 2010, Tom has worked on Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, SteamVR, and parts of Steam including the Steam Workshop and the Store. He's also the beneficiary of one of the best fan tributes we've ever received.											</p>

												Tristan earned a degree in transportation design. After a dipping a toe into industrial design, he found his way into making models for games, eventually landing at Valve to help with Half Life 2, Episode 2.  Since then He's been delighted to get away with building all sorts of models and art for Portal 2, Left 4 Dead, Team fortress 2, among others.  Outside of Valve, Tristan enjoys the decision paralysis that comes from making art and models in the real world where there is no Ctrl Z.											</p>

												Unlike most people at Valve, Amy was actually born and raised right here in Washington, on Whidbey Island. And like all native Washingtonians talking to transplants, she will remind you of this fact roughly twice a minute in any given conversation. After many years working at Zillow, Amy took a break from work to enjoy time with her family and learn how to cook some bucket list foods, like Beef Wellington and Lasagna Bolognese from scratch. Years later, sitting in her kitchen surrounded by pans of Beef Wellington, Amy realized it was either time to pick some new foods or get back to work. Since joining Valve Amy has found a second family. She gets the opportunity to work with exceptionally talented and incredibly kind people every day, and to spend every day helping to make their experience at Valve better.  When she’s not working, Amy’s favorite passion is to travel. Be sure to ask her about Utila next time you see her!											</p>

His responsibilities there included developer support, porting products to hardware, sample code, simple demos, and ultimately working with the 3Dfx developer relations team to manage the engineering game porting effort. Charlie left 3Dfx after two years and, with his college friend Gary McTaggart, created the Uber(tm) Engine at Ritual Entertainment in Dallas, Texas. Not long after joining Ritual, Charlie and Gary left to start their own company. Not long after that, Valve made Charlie (and Gary) an offer "they couldn't refuse."											</p>

												Alireza moved to Canada (via Iran and Turkey) when he was nine. His first impressions of the west were the films TRON, Die Hard, and Lawnmower Man. Inspired by this trinity of action, art, and science he chose a career in 3D animation and visual effects. After earning a Bachelor's and a post-graduate degree in animation from Sheridan Institute of Technology, Ali went to London to start work on his first film. He was 24. He now works at Valve where he drives the effort to transform visual effects into a dynamic interactive experience - and blows stuff up.											</p>

												Dario started designing levels for Doom while he was studying economics at the University of Oxford in England. After building "Final Doom: The Plutonia Experiment" with his brother, he joined Valve where he discovered that it was actually possible to have a career in games. Upon graduating from Oxford in 1996, he decided that the finance world would just have to wait. After all these years in the U.S., Dario still stubbornly refuses to give up his accent, and happily endures being the subject of British jokes on a daily basis.											</p>

She enjoys being part of the tight-knit technical art community, a small (but growing) collection of other artist-programmers who work in games. Growing up in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, she had an idyllic science nerd childhood. Her first experience with programming happened during a summer camp at Carleton University, where kids also got to synthesize nylon, extract cow DNA, and do the time warp again. Although Bronwen has a diploma in Digital Media Arts from Seneca College, she would say her education was mostly self-designed. She has taken classes in art, programming, and math from a half-dozen different schools to suit her unusual discipline. If she had to describe her specialty, it would be "look developer," but her daily tasks fall along a wide spectrum including UI programming, character modeling, and tools programming.											</p>

He's now animating on Dota 2.

He is (as far as we know) the only person in the world to have worked on four of Wired magazine's top-rated vaporware games. When Half-Life 2 shipped in 2004, the curse that prevented games that Matt worked on from getting shipped was finally broken. Now, he helps Valve ship games often, working primarily as a level and game designer, and gameplay programmer. Matt is happy to say that (in addition to the games mentioned above) he’s contributed to - and shipped Counter-Strike: Source, Half-Life: Episode One, Half-Life: Episode Two, Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, Alien Swarm, and Portal 2 on multiple platforms.											</p>

When that didn’t happen, and after the Internet bubble burst, he decided to forget all that web-based, e-commerce stuff and pursue his real dream: making video games. He joined Midway Games West (formerly, the original Atari). That studio shut down a few months later, so Tom moved on to Maxis where he worked on titles such as Darkspore, Spore, and The Sims 2 (and many of its expansion packs). Since joining Valve in 2010, Tom has worked on Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, SteamVR, and parts of Steam including the Steam Workshop and the Store. He's also the beneficiary of one of the best fan tributes we've ever received.											</p>

												Jay joined Valve from Tetragon where he was lead engineer and 3D engine developer of Virgin's Nanotek Warrior. Before that, he developed titles for Sony Playstation & 3DO. Way before that, he wrote his first computer game (at age 9) and had a game published in a magazine (at age 15). A native of Cajun Country, Jay finds Northwest buildings too hot (what, no air conditioning?) and the food not hot enough.											</p>

Having a real estate background, he quickly investigated different organizational methods and operations to streamline all types of housekeeping chores to make sure the people behind the great games and services here at Valve are able to focus on what they do best. 											</p>

												Kelly came to Valve via the Half-Life mod community. While earning a Master's degree in Business at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he helped develop and do sound work for Day of Defeat. He saw a career in video game development and sound engineering as the obvious next step after the MBA - and an undergraduate degree in Biology - so he packed his things and headed west to Valve. Today, you can find Kelly in his office, surrounded by WWII books and memorabilia, wearing a fat pair of headphones, and wondering how in the world he actually landed a job he loves doing.											</p>

												Liam showed early promise in his summer job at General Motors making car transmissions. Twice, GM and the UAW awarded him a Certificate of Perfect Attendance. But Liam left the assembly line for the classroom, teaching college and junior high math until a professor named Yau (that would be the Fields Medal-winning Shing-Tung Yau) convinced him to look for other work. Liam's interest in understanding the rules that govern society led him to law school, and then to Seattle's K&L Gates firm where he specialized in technology and business law and worked with a number of game companies, including Valve. Right before joining Valve, Liam served as general counsel of Zillow.com. 											</p>

												Matthew loved to play video games as a child. His parents warned him that playing games wasn't going to get him a job in the future. After graduating from the University of Washington in 2010, he proved them wrong by landing a job at Valve. As part of Valve’s Steam Support Team, Matthew helps support our Korean community and localizing efforts, making thousands of Korean Steam users believe we actually have offices in Korea. Matthew also uses his Photoshop skills to help make sure advertisements for sales and promotions get properly translated and presented to Steam users in Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, French, and German - just to name a few. In his spare time he enjoys playing soccer and any first-person shooter game he can get his hands on.											</p>

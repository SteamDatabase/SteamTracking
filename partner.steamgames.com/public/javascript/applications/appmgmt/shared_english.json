No fan of swimming, Rat hitched a ride atop the trusty Ox—excitedly jumping into the Emperor's garden just before the pair were set to reach shore.\n\nSteady Ox crossed the river with ease. Unconcerned with the results of the race, Ox felt content with a role in Rat's success.",
    "Lunar2020_StoryDayTwo": "Self-sufficient Tiger traveled too carefully to outpace Ox, thinking it better to arrive third than not at all.\n\nSwift Rabbit hopped a log floating nowhere fast. But luck paid off where strategy didn't, and a helpful wind sped the makeshift boat safely on its way.\n\nFlying Dragon's vantage revealed a village in need, so of course Dragon stopped to help—even gifting Rabbit a gust across the river. Honor was far more important than victory, and Dragon found fifth place a fine fit.",
    "Lunar2020_StoryDayThree": "Stealthy Snake had little interest in a long-distance effort, so it wrapped itself unnoticed around Horse's front hoof.\n\nAs Horse galloped towards the finish line, Snake uncoiled, startling the steed just long enough to slither into sixth—with the skittish Horse trotting close behind.",
    "Lunar2020_StoryDayFour": "Goat, Monkey, and Rooster worked together, but let Goat claim eighth as the backbone of their journey. Cheerful Monkey was next, and the strutting Rooster crossed tenth, proud that the order was fair.\n\nPlayful Dog was mostly interested in splashing around, feeling eleventh a fine trade for all the fun.\n\nLast came Pig, who'd stopped for a snack n' a snooze—wise enough to know that each animal will have their time in the Emperor's favor.",

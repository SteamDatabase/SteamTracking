If the control feels 'mushy' with a physical area of movement where no output is seen in game, it is likely caused by the game's deadzone. You can remove this using the Anti-Deadzone setting. This subtracts away the deadzone, and provides finer grain control within the remaining section.  The higher the slider, the more is added to the smallest output value.  Note that if all deadzone is removed entirely, all positions will cause input. You can use Anti-DeadZone Buffer to allow for a small area where no input will be sent, even if the anti-deadzone is larger than the deadzone of the game.",

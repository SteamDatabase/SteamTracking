	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update" "The Steam Controller Update"
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_BusyMonth" "It's been a busy month since the Steam controller officially launched, and with the help of the community, it's already grown so much. Along with the new features in today's update, we thought we'd highlight some of the other big features added in that month."

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_Gyro_Header" "Gyro"
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_Gyro_Description" "One of the community's biggest discoveries was how well FPS aiming worked when you combined trackpad and gyro input. Relying on the trackpad for large scale turns, and the gyro for fine tuning, community members found they were much more competitive than they were expecting."
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_Gyro_SeeVideo" "See Video"


	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_Moystick_Header" "Mouse-Like Joystick mode"
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_Moystick_Description" "Many games with full controller support expect a joystick for camera control, but PC gamers like their mouse for good reason. Thanks to mntorankusu's suggestion, we found a much superior method of emulating joystick cameras, so that it feels like you're aiming with a mouse when playing a first or third person game."
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_Moystick_Description2" "Some games don't support simultaneous mouse and gamepad input. With Mouse-Like Joystick you can play with gamepad input and still enjoy mouse accuracy."

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_TouchMenu_Header" "Touch Menu"
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_TouchMenu_Description" "Some games have hotkeys that are infequently used, but you still want to have at your fingertips. We added the Touch Menu, a fully configurable UI with up to 16 buttons, allowing you to select your desired hotkey on a single trackpad."

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_MouseRegions_Header" "Mouse Regions"
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_MouseRegions_Description" "Many PC RTS & RPG games have complex on-screen UI for minimaps, spell bars, inventory slots, and so on.

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_ConfigurationTravelling_Header" "Configuration Travelling"
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_ConfigurationTravelling_Description" "Want to play some co-op games at a friend's house? We wanted to make it easy to take your controller with you, so today we're shipping a new feature that ensures your controller's game configurations travel with it, even when you're playing a co-op game on a friend's Steam account.\n\n*Currently available in Steam Beta client"

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_HomeTheaterPC_Header" "Home Theater PCs"
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_HomeTheaterPC_Description" "One of the things we weren't expecting was that so many users would find the Steam Controller great at controlling their HTPC outside of playing games. These users have made a number of great suggestions, and we've managed to ship some of them already."
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_HomeTheaterPC_Description2" "Bring up the On-screen Keyboard whenever you want to enter some text."

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_Shortcut_Header" "Non-Steam Game support"
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_Shortcut_Description" "Another thing the community has asked for is the ability to share configurations for games bought somewhere other than Steam. Today's update adds that as well, so add your favorite non-Steam game to your library, and we'll automatically find configurations that other users have published."

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_ControllerHUD_Header" "Controller HUD"
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Controller_Update_ControllerHUD_Description" "With the community rapidly creating and sharing so many different ways to use the Steam Controller, we wanted to make it easier to learn how your controller is operating. The new Controller HUD allows you to easily see exactly what input your controller is generating."

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Sub_NoProd_H"		"Discover the best new games"
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Sub_NoProd_D"		"Head over to the Steam Store to find great deals on the newest games or browse to find classic games you might have missed. Check out Free-to-Play games for some free entertainment, or explore the Early Access titles to get involved in games as they develop."
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Sub_NoFriends_H"	"Keep up with friends"

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Sub_NoFriends_E"	"Join the millions of other players on Steam. You can add any other player to your friends list and chat, comment on their posted screenshots and movies, invite them to multiplayer games, and much more."

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Sub_Controller_2"	"ADJUST THE SENSITIVITY of your controller pads when using them to control a camera."
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Sub_Controller_3"	"When playing a new game, it's best to start with a popular community created config, or one of our genre templates."
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Sub_Controller_4"	"The grip buttons (found underneath the controller) are great for commands that you want to be able to use without removing your thumbs from the pads (like reload in an FPS)."
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Sub_Controller_5"	"Select the Open Keyboard option in the Steam Overlay when playing a game that requires you to enter some keyboard text."
	"MainMenu_Welcome_Sub_Controller_5_Hint"		"OPEN KEYBOARD"

	"MainMenu_Welcome_Sub_Security_PhoneA"					"Add an SMS phone number"

	"ControllerBinding_AntiDeadZone_joystick_move_Description" "Most games apply their own deadzones to controller output. If the control feels 'mushy' with a physical area of movement where no output is seen in game, it is likely caused by the game's deadzone. You can remove this using the Anti-Deadzone setting. This subtracts away the deadzone, and provides finer grain control within the remaining section.  The higher the slider, the more is added to the smallest output value.  Note that if all deadzone is removed entirely, all positions will cause input. You can use Anti-DeadZone Buffer to allow for a small area where no input will be sent, even if the anti-deadzone is larger than the deadzone of the game."

	"ControllerBinding_TriggerDeadZoneEnd" "Trigger Range End"
	"ControllerBinding_TriggerDeadZoneEnd_Description" "This sets the deadzone for the analog trigger.  A smaller value will create more of a 'deadzone' at the end of the range where the maximum analog value will be sent once past this point in the throw."
	"ControllerBinding_TriggerCurveExponent" "Triger Response Curve"
	"ControllerBinding_TriggerCurveExponent_Description" "This determines the mapping of analog input to output.  By default a linear 1:1 mapping is used.  This curve can altered so there is more or less room for fine controls."

	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold" "Threshold Trigger Style"
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_Description" "The trigger threshold can be set up in a few ways.  This will vary based on how you want to use this threshold in what style of game.  In a mouse based click and drag environment, the Simple Threshold is likely the best option.  In an FPS with a single function bound to the trigger, Hair Trigger will likely give the most responsive feel when rapidly pulling the trigger.  In a game where dual stage triggers are enabled via the threshold as well as the click, hip fire allows a quick pull of the trigger to hit the physical button without engaging the threshold action, while a slower pull will engage the threshold first.  Aggressive Hip Fire will engage the threshold action much faster than Relaxed."
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_HairTrigger" "Threshold Hair Trigger"
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_HairTrigger_Description" "With the Hair Trigger setting, the threshold will adapt to the user.  Once the initial threshold has been passed, letting off the trigger by any degree will reset the trigger, allowing it to be pressed again, even if the trigger hasn't been released to the point of the initial threshold.  This is often desirable for situations like rapid firing a weapon where you want a small amount of throw to fire the first shot, but you don't want to have to let it return to full unpressed to fire again.  For actions that require holding the trigger continually, it may be less desirable, as any lessing of the trigger will cause the selected binding to release."
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_Simple" "Simple Threshold"
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_Simple_Description" "Basic Threshold, the threshold is at a fixed throw specified by the selected value.  Once the speficied threshold has been passed, letting off the trigger will not release the button until the trigger has been released to the point of the specified threshold.  For actions that require holding the trigger continually, where accidental button release is undesirable, this may be the preferred setting."
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_LongPressShort" "Hip Fire Aggressive"
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_LongPressShort_Description" "Intended to be used with a dual-stage trigger setup, Hip Fire allows a quick pull of the trigger to engage the click without engaging the threshold.  A slower pull or hover will engage the threshold action.  This allows for actions such as iron-sights to be set on the threshold and fire on the click, while still allowing a quick pull to click to fire without entering iron-sights.  Additionally, once the click has been hit, the threshold won't be engaged until the trigger has been released outside of the threshold range, allowing it to be primed for additional clicks.  Aggressive Hip Fire mode is a very small window before engaging the threshold, requiring a very fast pull of the trigger to skip it.  The Threshold action will engage fastest here when intentionally enaging it."
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_LongPressMedium" "Hip Fire Normal"
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_LongPressMedium_Description" "Intended to be used with a dual-stage trigger setup, Hip Fire allows a quick pull of the trigger to engage the click without engaging the threshold.  A slower pull or hover will engage the threshold action.  This allows for actions such as iron-sights to be set on the threshold and fire on the click, while still allowing a quick pull to click to fire without entering iron-sights.  Additionally, once the click has been hit, the threshold won't be engaged until the trigger has been released outside of the threshold range, allowing it to be primed for additional clicks.  Normal Hip Fire mode has a window before engaging the threshold, requiring a quick pull of the trigger to avoid it."
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_LongPressLong" "Hip Fire Relaxed"
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_LongPressLong_Description" "Intended to be used with a dual-stage trigger setup, Hip Fire allows a quick pull of the trigger to engage the click without engaging the threshold.  A slower pull or hover will engage the threshold action.  This allows for actions such as iron-sights to be set on the threshold and fire on the click, while still allowing a quick pull to click to fire without entering iron-sights.  Additionally, once the click has been hit, the threshold won't be engaged until the trigger has been released outside of the threshold range, allowing it to be primed for additional clicks.  Relaxed Hip Fire mode is a larger window before engaging the threshold, allowing a slower pull of the trigger to avoid it.  This means the Threshold action will be slightly less responsive when intentionally trying to engage."
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_LongPressExclusive" "Hip Fire Exclusive"
	"ControllerBinding_AdaptiveThreshold_LongPressExclusive_Description" "Intended to be used with a dual-stage trigger setup, Hip Fire allows a quick pull of the trigger to engage the click without engaging the threshold.  A slower pull or hover will engage the threshold action.  With Exclusive Hip Fire, if the Soft Pull action is engaged, the Full Pull option will no longer function.  So in Exclusive mode, you can activate either the Full or Soft pull, but not both."

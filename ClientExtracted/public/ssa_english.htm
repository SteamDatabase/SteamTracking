	<p>If you are a Subscriber whose primary residence is in one of the member countries of the European Union (an &ldquo;EU Subscriber&rdquo;), your Subscriber relationship is with Valve S.a.r.l. (&ldquo;Valve EU&rdquo;).  For all other Subscribers, your Subscriber relationship is with Valve Corporation (&ldquo;Valve US&rdquo;). Except as otherwise indicated at the time of purchase (such as in the case of purchases from another Subscriber in a Subscription Marketplace), any purchases you make are being made from the Valve entity that you are contracting with. Unless otherwise set forth in the below terms, any reference to &ldquo;Valve&rdquo; in this Agreement shall mean Valve EU if you are an EU Subscriber, and shall mean Valve US if you are any other Subscriber.  Any reference to &ldquo;Valve&rdquo; in any Rules of Use or Subscription Terms shall, if and as the context requires, mean Valve EU, if you are an EU Subscriber, and shall mean Valve US otherwise.</p>
	<p><b>SECTION 12 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. PLEASE READ IT. IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, SOME OR ALL OF SECTION 12 MIGHT NOT APPLY TO YOU. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU LIVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, SECTION 12 DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.</b></p>

	<p>As a Subscriber you may obtain access to certain services, software and content available to Subscribers.  The Steam client software and any other software, content, and updates you download or access via Steam, including but not limited to Valve or third-party video games and in-game content, and any virtual items you trade, sell or purchase in a Steam Subscription Marketplace are referred to in this Agreement as &ldquo;Software&rdquo;; the rights to access and/or use any services, Software and/or content accessible through Steam are referred to in this Agreement as &quot;Subscriptions.&quot;  </p>
	<p>Each Subscription allows you to access particular services, software and/or other content.

Also, additional terms (for example, payment and billing procedures) may be posted on <a target="_new" href="http://www.steampowered.com">http://www.steampowered.com</a> or within the Steam service (&quot;Rules of Use&quot;). Rules of Use include the Steam Online Conduct Rules, which can be found at <a target="_new" href="http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct">http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct</a>.  The Subscription Terms, the Rules of Use, and the Valve Privacy Policy (which can be found at <a target="_new" href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/privacy.htm">http://www.valvesoftware.com/privacy.htm</a>) are binding on you once you indicate your acceptance of them or of this Agreement, or otherwise become bound by them as described in Section 9 (Amendments to this Agreement).</p>
	<p>When you complete Steam’s registration process, you create a Steam account (&quot;Account&quot;). Your Account may also include billing information you provide to Valve for the purchase of Subscriptions.

Valve hereby grants, and you accept, a limited, terminable, non-exclusive license and right to use the Software for your personal, non-commercial use (except where commercial use is expressly allowed herein or in the applicable Subscription Terms) in accordance with this Agreement, including the Subscription Terms.

To make use of the Software, you must have a Steam Account and you may be required to be running the Steam client and maintaining a connection to the Internet.  </p>
	<p>For reasons that include, without limitation, system security, stability, and multiplayer interoperability, Steam may need to automatically update, pre-load, create new versions of or otherwise enhance the Software and accordingly, the system requirements to use the Software may change over time. You consent to such automatic updating.  You understand that this Agreement (including applicable Subscription Terms) does not entitle you to future updates, new versions or other enhancements of the Software associated with a particular Subscription, although Valve may choose to provide such updates, etc. in its sole discretion.</p>
	<p>B. Beta Software License</p>
	<p>Valve may from time to time make software accessible to you via Steam prior to the general commercial release of such software (&quot;Beta Software&quot;). You are not required to use Beta Software, but if Valve offers it, you may elect to use it under the following terms.

	<p>D. License to Use Valve Game IP in Fan Art.</p>
	<p>Valve appreciates the community of Subscribers that creates fan art, fan fiction, and audio-visual works that reference Valve games (&quot;Fan Art&quot;).  You may incorporate content from Valve games into your Fan Art.

	<p>E. License to Use Valve Dedicated Server Software </p>
	<p>Your Subscription(s) may contain access to the Valve Dedicated Server Software. If so, you may use the Valve Dedicated Server Software on an unlimited number of computers for the purpose of hosting online multiplayer games of Valve products. If you wish to operate the Valve Dedicated Server Software, you will be solely responsible for procuring any Internet access, bandwidth, or hardware for such activities and will bear all costs associated therewith.</p>
	<p>F. Ownership of Software</p>
	<p>All title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Software and any and all copies thereof, are owned by Valve US and/or its or its affiliates’ licensors. All rights are reserved, except as expressly stated herein. The Software is protected by copyright laws, international copyright treaties and conventions and other laws. The Software contains certain licensed materials and Valve’s and its affiliates’ licensors may protect their rights in the event of any violation of this Agreement.</p>
	<p>G. Restrictions on Use of Software</p>
	<p>You may not use the Software for any purpose other than the permitted access to Steam and your Subscriptions, and to make personal, non-commercial use of your Subscriptions, except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement or applicable Subscription Terms.  Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use), or under applicable law notwithstanding these restrictions, you may not, in whole or in part, copy, photocopy, reproduce, publish, distribute, translate, reverse engineer, derive source code from, modify, disassemble, decompile, create derivative works based on, or remove any proprietary notices or labels from the Software or any software accessed via Steam without the prior consent, in writing, of Valve.</p>
	<p>Unless you are a Licensed Cybercafe Operator (as defined below), this Agreement does not allow you to  use the Software at a Cybercafe, computer gaming center or any other location-based site. A &quot;Cybercafe&quot; is a physical establishment in which computer stations are made available for use by customers. A &quot;Licensed Cybercafe Operator&quot; is a Cybercafe that has agreed to the Subscription Terms for Licensed Cybercafe Operators posted at <a target="_new" href="http://store.steampowered.com/cybercafe_agreement/">http://store.steampowered.com/cybercafe_agreement/</a>.</p>
	<p>You are entitled to use the Software for your own personal use, but you are not entitled to: (i) sell, grant a security interest in or transfer reproductions of the Software to other parties in any way, nor to rent, lease or license the Software to others without the prior written consent of Valve, except to the extent expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use); (ii) host or provide matchmaking services for the Software or emulate or redirect the communication protocols used by Valve in any network feature of the Software, through protocol emulation, tunneling, modifying or adding components to the Software, use of a utility program or any other techniques now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose including, but not limited to network play over the Internet, network play utilizing commercial or non-commercial gaming networks or as part of content aggregation networks, websites or services, without the prior written consent of Valve; or (iii) exploit the Software or any of its parts for any commercial purpose, except as expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use). </p>
	<p>3. BILLING, PAYMENT AND OTHER SUBSCRIPTIONS</p>
	<p>ALL CHARGES INCURRED ON STEAM, AND ALL PURCHASES MADE WITH THE STEAM WALLET, ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART, REGARDLESS OF THE PAYMENT METHOD, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.  </p>
	<p>IF YOU ARE AN EU SUBSCRIBER YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM A PURCHASE TRANSACTION FOR DIGITAL CONTENT WITHOUT CHARGE AND WITHOUT GIVING ANY REASON UNTIL DELIVERY OF SUCH CONTENT HAS STARTED OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE HAS COMMENCED.  YOU DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM A TRANSACTION OR OBTAIN A REFUND ONCE DELIVERY OF THE CONTENT HAS STARTED OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE HAS COMMENCED, AT WHICH POINT YOUR TRANSACTION IS FINAL.  YOU AGREE THAT DELIVERY OF DIGITAL CONTENT, AND THE ASSOCIATED SUBSCRIPTION, AND/OR PERFORMANCE OF THE ASSOCIATED SERVICE, COMMENCES AT THE MOMENT THE DIGITAL CONTENT IS ADDED TO YOUR ACCOUNT OR INVENTORY OR OTHERWISE MADE ACCESSIBLE TO YOU FOR DOWNLOAD OR USE.  </p>
	<p>A. Payment Authorization</p>
	<p>When you provide payment information to Valve or to one of its payment processors, you represent to Valve that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with that payment, and you authorize Valve to charge your credit card or to process your payment with the chosen third-party payment processor for any Subscription, Steam Wallet funds, or other fees incurred by you. Valve may require you to provide your address or other information in order to meet Valve’s obligations under applicable tax law.  </p>
	<p>For Subscriptions purchased based on an agreed usage period, where recurring payments are made in exchange for continued use (&ldquo;Recurring Payment Subscriptions&rdquo;), by continuing to use the Recurring Payment Subscription you agree and reaffirm that Valve is authorized to charge your credit card (or your Steam Wallet, if funded), or to process your payment with any other applicable third-party payment processor, for any applicable recurring payment amounts. If you have purchased any Recurring Payment Subscriptions, you agree to notify Valve promptly of any changes to your credit card account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, or your PayPal or other payment account number, and you agree to notify Valve promptly if your credit card or PayPal or other payment account expires or is canceled for any reason.</p>
	<p>If your use of Steam is subject to any type of use or sales tax, then Valve may also charge you for those taxes, in addition to the Subscription or other fees published in the Rules of Use. The European Union VAT (&ldquo;VAT&rdquo;) tax amounts collected by Valve reflect VAT due on the value of any Software or Subscription.</p>
	<p>You agree that you will not use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your residence, whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on game content, to purchase at pricing not applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose.  If you do this, we may terminate your access to your Account.</p>
	<p>B. Responsibility for Charges Associated With Your Account</p>
	<p>As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends. If you cancel your Account, Valve reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred before cancellation. Any delinquent or unpaid Accounts must be settled before Valve will allow you to register again.</p>
	<p>C. Steam Wallet</p>
	<p>Steam may make available an account balance associated with your Account (the &ldquo;Steam Wallet&rdquo;). You may place funds in your Steam Wallet up to a maximum amount determined by Valve, by credit card, prepaid card, promotional code, or any other payment method accepted by Steam.  Within any twenty-four (24) hour period, the total amount stored in your Steam Wallet plus the total amount spent out of your Steam Wallet, in the aggregate, may not exceed $2,000 US or its equivalent in your applicable local currency -- attempted deposits into your Steam Wallet that exceed this threshold may not be credited to your Steam Wallet until your activity falls below this threshold. We may change or impose different Steam Wallet balance and usage limits from time to time.</p>
	<p>You may use Steam Wallet funds to purchase Subscriptions, including by making in-game purchases where Steam Wallet transactions are enabled. Funds added to the Steam Wallet are non-refundable and non-transferable. Steam Wallet funds do not constitute a personal property right, have no value outside Steam and can only be used to purchase Subscriptions and related content via Steam (including but not limited to games and other applications offered through the Steam Store, or in a Steam Subscription Marketplace). Steam Wallet funds have no cash value and are not exchangeable for cash. Steam Wallet funds that are deemed unclaimed property may be turned over to the applicable authority.</p>
	<p>D. Trading and Sales of Subscriptions Between Subscribers</p>
	<p>Steam may include  one or more features or sites that allow Subscribers to trade, sell or purchase certain types of Subscriptions (for example, license rights to virtual items) with, to or from other Subscribers (&ldquo;Subscription Marketplaces&rdquo;). An example of a Subscription Marketplace is the Steam Community Market. By using or participating in Subscription Marketplaces, you authorize Valve, on its own behalf or as an agent or licensee of any third-party creator or publisher of the applicable Subscriptions in your Account, to transfer those Subscriptions from your Account in order to give effect to any trade or sale you make.</p>
	<p>Valve may charge a fee for trades or sales in a Subscription Marketplace.  Any fees will be disclosed to you in connection with the trade or sale.</p>
	<p>If you complete a trade, sale or purchase in a Subscription Marketplace, you acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for taxes, if any, which may be due with respect to your transactions, including sales or use taxes, and for compliance with applicable tax laws.  Proceeds from sales you make in a Subscription Marketplace may be considered income to you for income tax purposes.  You should consult with a tax specialist to determine your tax liability in connection with your activities in any Subscription Marketplace.</p>
	<p>You understand and acknowledge that Valve may decide to cease operation of any Subscription Marketplace, change the fees that it charges or change the terms or features of the Steam Subscription Marketplace. Valve shall have no liability to you because of any inability to trade Subscriptions in the Steam Trading Marketplace, including because of discontinuation or changes in the terms, features or eligibility requirements of any Subscription Marketplace.</p>
	<p>You also understand and acknowledge that Subscriptions traded, sold or purchased in any Subscription Marketplace are license rights, that you have no ownership interest in such Subscriptions, and that Valve does not recognize any transfers of Subscriptions (including transfers by operation of law) that are made outside of Steam.</p>
	<p>E. Retail Purchase</p>
	<p>Valve may offer or require a Subscription for purchasers of retail packaged product versions or OEM versions of Valve products. The &quot;CD-Key&quot; or &quot;Product Key&quot; accompanying such versions is used to activate your Subscription.</p>
	<p>F. Steam Authorized Resellers</p>
	<p>You may purchase a Subscription through an authorized reseller of Valve. The &quot;Product Key&quot; accompanying such purchase will be used to activate your Subscription. If you purchase a Subscription from an authorized reseller of Valve, you agree to direct all questions regarding the Product Key to that reseller.</p>
	<p>G. Free Subscriptions</p>
	<p>In some cases, Valve may offer a free Subscription to certain services, software and content. As with all Subscriptions, you are always responsible for any Internet service provider, telephone, and other connection fees that you may incur when using Steam, even when Valve offers a free Subscription.</p>
	<p>H. Third Party Sites</p>
	<p>Steam may provide links to other third party sites. Some of these sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in and are in addition to any Subscription or other fees that you may pay to Valve. Steam may also provide access to third-party vendors, who provide content, goods and/or services on Steam or the Internet. Any separate charges or obligations you incur in your dealings with these third parties are your responsibility. Valve makes no representations or warranties, either express or implied, regarding any third party site.  In particular, Valve makes no representation or warranty that any service or subscription offered via third-party vendors will not change or be suspended or terminated.</p>
	<p>4. ONLINE CONDUCT, CHEATING AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR</p>
	<p>You agree that you will be personally responsible for the use of your Account and for all of the communication and activity on Steam that results from use of your Account. Your online conduct and interaction with other Subscribers should be guided by common sense and basic etiquette. Specific requirements may also be found in the Steam Online Conduct rules at <a target="_new" href="http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct">http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct</a>, other Rules of Use, the Subscription Terms, or in terms of use imposed by third parties who host particular games or other services.</p>
	<p>Steam and the Software may include functionality designed to identify software or hardware processes or functionality that may give a player an unfair competitive advantage when playing multiplayer versions of any Software or modifications of Software (&ldquo;Cheats&rdquo;). You agree that you will not create Cheats or assist third parties in any way to create Cheats. You agree that you will not directly or indirectly disable, circumvent, or otherwise interfere with the operation of software designed to prevent or report the use of Cheats. You acknowledge and agree that either Valve or any online multiplayer host may refuse to allow you to participate in certain online multiplayer games if you use Cheats in connection with Steam or the Software. Further, you acknowledge and agree that an online multiplayer host may report your use of Cheats to Valve, and Valve may communicate your history of use of Cheats to other online multiplayer hosts. Valve may terminate your Account or a particular Subscription for any conduct or activity that Valve believes is illegal, constitutes a Cheat, or otherwise negatively affects the enjoyment of Steam by other Subscribers. You acknowledge that Valve is not required to provide you notice before terminating your Subscriptions(s) and/or Account, but it may choose to do so.</p>
	<p>You may not use Cheats, automation software (bots), mods, hacks, or any other unauthorized third-party software, to modify or automate any Subscription Marketplace process.</p>
	<p>5. THIRD PARTY CONTENT</p>
	<p>In regard to all Subscriptions, Software, and related content that are not authored by Valve, Valve does not screen such third party content available on Steam or through other sources. Valve does not assume any responsibility or liability for such third party content.  Some third party application Software is capable of being used by businesses for business purposes - however, you may only acquire such Software via Steam for private personal use.</p>
	<p>6. USER GENERATED CONTENT</p>
	<p>A. General Provisions </p>
	<p>&quot;User Generated Content&quot; means any content you make available to other users through your use of multi-user features of Steam, or to Valve or its affiliates through your use of the Software or otherwise.</p>
	<p>You grant Valve and its affiliates the non-exclusive, irrevocable right to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and publicly display and publicly perform, your User Generated Content, and derivative works of your User Generated Content, in connection with the operation and promotion of the Steam site.   If you use Valve cloud storage, you grant us a license to store your information as part of that service.  We may place limits on the amount of storage you may use.</p>
	<p>If you provide Valve with any feedback or suggestions about Steam, the Software, or any Valve products or services, Valve is free to use the feedback or suggestions however it chooses, without any obligation to account to you.</p>
	<p>B. Content Uploaded to the Steam Workshop</p>
	<p>Some games or applications available on Steam (&quot;Workshop-Enabled Apps&quot;) allow you to create User Generated Content based on or using the Workshop-Enabled App, and to submit that User Generated Content (a “Workshop Contribution”) to one or more Steam Workshop web pages.  Workshop Contributions can be viewed by the Steam community,  and for some categories of Workshop Contributions users may be able to interact with, download or purchase the Workshop Contribution.  In some cases, Workshop Contributions may be considered for incorporation by Valve or a third-party developer into a game or into a Subscription Marketplace.</p>  
	<p>You understand and agree that Valve is not obligated to use, distribute, or continue to distribute copies of any Workshop Contribution and reserves the right, but not the obligation, to restrict or remove Workshop Contributions for any reason.</p>
	<p>Specific Workshop-Enabled Apps or Workshop web pages may contain special terms (“App-Specific Terms”) that supplement or change the terms set out in this Section.  In particular, where Workshop Contributions are distributed for a fee, App-Specific Terms will address how revenue may be shared.  Unless otherwise specified in App-Specific Terms (if any), the following general rules apply to Workshop Contributions.</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Workshop Contributions are Subscriptions, and therefore you agree that any Subscriber receiving distribution of your Workshop Contribution will have the same rights to use your Workshop Contribution (and will be subject to the same restrictions) as are set out in this Agreement for any other Subscriptions.<br>
			<li>Notwithstanding the license described in Section 6.A., Valve will only have the right to modify or create derivative works from your Workshop Contribution in the following cases:  (a) Valve may make modifications necessary to make your Contribution compatible with Steam and the Workshop functionality or user interface, and (b) Valve or the applicable developer may make modifications to Workshop Contributions that are accepted for in-Application distribution as it deems necessary or desirable to enhance gameplay.
			<li>You may, in your sole discretion, choose to remove a Workshop Contribution from the applicable Workshop pages.  If you do so, Valve will no longer have the right to use, distribute, transmit, communicate, publicly display or publicly perform the Workshop Contribution, except that (a) Valve may continue to exercise these rights for any Workshop Contribution that is accepted for distribution in-game or distributed in a manner that allows it to be used in-game, and (b) your removal will not affect the rights of any Subscriber who has already obtained access to a copy of the Workshop Contribution.
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Except where otherwise provided in App-Specific Terms, you agree that Valve’s consideration of your Workshop Contribution is your full compensation, and you are not entitled to any other rights or compensation in connection with the rights granted to Valve and to other Subscribers.</p>
	<p>C. Representations and Warranties</p>
	<p>You represent and warrant to us that you have sufficient rights in all User Generated Content to grant Valve and other affected parties the licenses described under A. and B. above or in any license terms specific to the applicable Workshop-Enabled App or Workshop page. This includes, without limitation, any kind of intellectual property rights or other proprietary or personal rights affected by or included in the User Generated Content.  In particular, with respect to Workshop Contributions, you represent and warrant that the Workshop Contribution was originally created by you (or, with respect to a Workshop Contribution to which others contributed besides you, by you and the other contributors, and in such case that you have the right to submit such Workshop Contribution on behalf of those other contributors). </p>
	<p>You furthermore represent and warrant that the User Generated Content, your submission of that Content, and your granting of rights in that Content does not violate any applicable contract, law or regulation.</p> 
	<p>7. DISCLAIMERS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; NO GUARANTEES</p>
	<p>FOR EU CUSTOMERS, THIS SECTION 7 DOES NOT REDUCE YOUR MANDATORY CONSUMERS’ RIGHTS UNDER THE LAWS OF YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTION.</p>

	<p>11. APPLICABLE LAW/JURISDICTION</p>
	<p>For Subscribers other than EU Subscribers: </p>
	<p>You agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and executed in the State of Washington, U.S.A., and any dispute arising hereunder shall be resolved in accordance with the law of Washington. Subject to Section 12 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) below, you agree that any claim asserted in any legal proceeding by you against Valve shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the dispute between the parties and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.

	<p>For EU Subscribers:</p>

However, where the laws of Luxembourg provide a lower degree of consumer protection than the laws of your country of residence, the consumer protection laws of your country shall prevail.  In any dispute arising under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to attorneys’ fees and expenses.</p>
	<p>12. <b><u>DISPUTE RESOLUTION/BINDING ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER</u></b></p>
	<p>Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our Steam support site at <a target="_new" href="https://support.steampowered.com/">https://support.steampowered.com/</a>. If we are unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and Valve, this Section explains how we agree to resolve it.  </p>
	<p><b>YOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION. THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US; (ii) THIS AGREEMENT; OR (iii) YOUR USE OF STEAM, YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE SOFTWARE. IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.</b></p>
	<p>However, this Section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or Valve may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy or theft.</p>
	<p>This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.</p>
	<p>An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. <b>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND VALVE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</b></p>
	<p>You and Valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought. If you and Valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Valve may commence an arbitration. Written notice to Valve must be sent via postal mail to: ATTN: Arbitration Notice, Valve Corporation, P.O. Box 1688, Bellevue, WA 98004. </p>
	<p>The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) and, where applicable, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by this Agreement, both of which are available at <a target="_new" href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. </p>
	<p>The AAA will administer the arbitration. It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  </p>
	<p>If you seek $10,000 or less, Valve agrees to reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator. Valve agrees not to seek its attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator. If you seek more than $10,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and Valve according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, if applicable.  </p>
	<p><b>YOU AND VALVE AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA’s PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.</b> You and Valve also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this Agreement and all other actions or arbitrations.</p>
	<p>If the agreement in this Section not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration should be found illegal or unenforceable, you and Valve agree that it shall not be severable, that this entire Section shall be unenforceable and any claim or dispute would be resolved in court and not in collective arbitration. </p>
	<p>Notwithstanding this Section, you have the right to litigate any dispute in small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute, are satisfied. </p>
	<p>This Section 12 shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of some or all of the provisions of this Section notwithstanding Section 11 (Applicable Law/Jurisdiction), such provisions will not apply to you.  </p>
	<p>13. MISCELLANEOUS</p>
	<p>Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, in the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining portions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This Agreement, including any Subscription Terms, Rules of Use and the Valve Privacy Policy, constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements. You agree that this Agreement is not intended to confer and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties to this Agreement.</p>
	<p>Valve’s obligations are subject to existing laws and legal process and Valve may comply with law enforcement or regulatory requests or requirements notwithstanding any contrary term.</p>
	<p>You agree to comply with all applicable import/export laws and regulations. You agree not to export the Software or allow use of your Account by individuals of any terrorist supporting countries to which encryption exports are at the time of exportation restricted by the U.S. Bureau of Export Administration. You represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country.</p>

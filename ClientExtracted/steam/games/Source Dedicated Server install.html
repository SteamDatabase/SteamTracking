<h1>Source Dedicated Server</h1>
The "Source Dedicated Server" is a program which hosts a networked Steam game either on a private LAN or on the Internet. (If you just want to play Steam games, you don't need the Source Dedicated Server -- you can join online games by clicking on "Servers" in the Steam menu.)<br><br>
If you do want to run a game server and have other people connect to your server via a network, the easiest way to run a server is to click the "Download and Install" button below, which will add the Dedicated Sever to your "My Games" list. You'll be up and running in minutes.<br><br>
Advanced users can also run a Dedicated Server under the Linux operating system. <a target="_new" href="http://steampowered.com/?area=getsteamnow">Click here</a> to download the Linux version.<br><br>
Note that when running any version of the Dedicated Server, a certain amount of <a target="_new" href="http://steampowered.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/steampowered.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=160">network configuration</a> (opening ports, etc) may be required.

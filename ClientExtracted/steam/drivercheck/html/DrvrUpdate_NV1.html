Note: Video driver updates may request updates to more recent Windows Service Packs.<br><br>
In the unlikely event video driver installation fails, follow instructions at the driver support page. You may have to revert to an earlier video driver version.<br><br>
In addition, there is a slight chance upgrading video drivers can cause problems with other graphics-intensive applications (e.g. X, Y, Z). <br>
If this occurs, the other application may have updates or patches available on their website for download. <br>
If the other graphics application is critical and updates are unavailable, you may need to revert to older video driver. <br>
Visit the driver support page for details on reverting to older video drivers. <br>
Any problems with other graphics applications from updating video drivers should be reported to the application vendor and the video card manufacturer. <br>

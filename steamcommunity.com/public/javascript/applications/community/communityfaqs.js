Your account cannot be stolen if you follow these recommendations and refrain from sharing your account.</p>    <p>Watch out for these activities:</p>    <h5>Requests for login and password information</h5>    <p>Deny requests for login and password information from other users. Do not share your account login information with anyone. No reputable gaming clan will ask for your login information to join. Game server administrators do not need your Steam account information.</p>    <h5>Unsolicited messages from &quot;Steam Support&quot; (Phishing Scams)</h5>    <p>Ignore unsolicited messages from &quot;Steam Support&quot; unless the message originates from the <u>support.steampowered.com</u> domain. <strong>Do not send&nbsp;your password to anyone</strong></p>    <h5>Malicious programs in downloads</h5>    <p>It is common for executable ( .EXE ) files, Windows screensaver ( .SCR ) files, dynamic link libraries ( .DLL ) files, and batch ( .BAT ) files being offered as parts of &quot;mods&quot; to contain malicious software designed to steal Steam account login information. Hacks are another very common source of malicious programs.</p>    <div class="SteamChinaExclude">  <h5>Examples of hijacking attempts</h5>    <p>A list of common scams can be found <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/wiki/scamtypes">here</a>.</p>  </div>  </div>    <div class="float_right_section" id="general_div">  <p><a name="general"></a></p>  <img alt="" class="security_icon" src="images/faq/account_security/lock.png" />  <h4>General Security Recommendations</h4>    <p>In addition to selecting a strong password, it is a good idea to maintain the security of your system in the following ways:</p>    <p><a href="kb_article.php?ref=5151-RUAS-1543#verify" title="E-Mail Verification">Verify your contact email address with Steam</a></p>    <h5>Select a Strong Password</h5>    <p>A strong password is a necessary first step toward ensuring the security of your account. Your password should meet all of the minimum requirements listed below:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Use at least 6 characters</li>  \t<li>Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>  \t<li>Include at least one number within the password</li>  \t<li><u>Do not</u> use a name, a word that could be found in the dictionary, or a series of letters as it appears on the keyboard (&quot;qwerty&quot; and &quot;12345&quot; are not secure passwords)</li>  </ul>    <h5>Use unique passwords</h5>    <p>Make sure you are using a different password for your Steam account and your contact e-mail address.</p>    <p>If you participate in any gaming forums, make sure that your username and password on these forum sites (including Steam\'s own user forums) is <u>different</u> from your Steam Account name and password.</p>    <h5>Scan your computer</h5>    <p>Regularly scan your computer for viruses, key loggers, spyware, and other malicious code with a virus scan utility that has the most recent virus definitions.</p>    <h5>Avoid insecure computers</h5>    <p>Avoid accessing your Steam Account from internet cafes or shared computers - if you must use an internet cafe or shared computer, make sure it has been scanned for viruses, trojans, and keyloggers.</p>    <h5>Always log out of your account on shared machines</h5>    <p>If the machine you use to access Steam has multiple users, be sure to fully Exit (log out of) Steam when you are done using the machine (if the &quot;Remember Password&quot; option is checked or if Steam is minimized to the Windows system tray but not fully Exited another user may be able to access your account).</p>  </div>    <div style="clear: both">&nbsp;</div>    <div class="important">  <h3>Important:</h3>    <h5>Report Hijackings and Suspicious Activities</h5>    <p>If your account has been compromised, please see the <a href="kb_article.php?ref=2347-QDFN-4366" title="Retrieving a Lost or Stolen Steam Account">Retrieving a Lost or Stolen Steam Account</a> topic for instructions to retrieve your account.</p>    <p>If another user requests your account information or attempts to steal your account, please see the <a href="kb_article.php?ref=1476-HJCM-5616" title="Reporting abusive behavior within the Steam Community">Reporting abusive behavior within the Steam Community</a> topic for instructions to submit a report.</p>  </div>    <p>&nbsp;</p>',

Most embedded firewalls require you to open ports manually (they do not automatically learn your used ports). Routers without firewalls rarely need to have ports opened for a game client, but usually do for game servers.</p>    \t<p>If you can specify ports to open, please use the ports specified in the following article: <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8571-GLVN-8711">Required Ports for Steam</a></p>    \t<p>After making any changes to your router and firewall settings please <strong>EXIT STEAM AND RESTART</strong> before attempting to connect to a secure server.</p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<h4 class="subheading">Router Problems</h4>    \t<p>Routers can cause connectivity problems, especially Wireless routers. If you have a stand-alone router and you are having connection problems, you can always bypass the router and plug your computer directly into your modem to see if the router is the problem.</p>    \t<p>If you determine that the router is the source of the issue, please follow the <a href="kb_article.php?ref=6776-MYXU-0480" title="Using a Router with Steam">Using a Router with Steam</a> guide.</p>    \t<p>Dual WAN Routers are not compatible with Steam.</p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<h4 class="subheading">Internet Connectivity Issues</h4>    \t<p>Check the stability and reliability of your Internet connection. An unstable connection can cause Steam to download improperly and connections to game servers time out.</p>    \t<p>There are many online tools that help you to check for problems with your connection, here are two of the most popular ones:<br />  \t<a href="http://www.dslreports.com/tools">http://www.dslreports.com/tools</a><br />  \t<a href="http://www.speedguide.net/analyzer.php">http://www.speedguide.net/analyzer.php</a></p>    \t<p>If you suspect that you are having a problem related to your Internet Connection, please contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>  \t</li>  </ul>    <p><a name="security"></a></p>    <h4>Security Software</h4>    <ul>  \t<li>  \t<h4 class="subheading">Security, Firewall, and Anti-Virus Software</h4>    \t<p>If you&#39;re using Internet security, firewall or anti-virus software, make sure they are set to recognize Steam.exe and all instances of HL.exe and HL2.exe as trusted programs. Please consult your security program manuals for instructions.</p>    \t<h5>Problems Directly After a Steam Update</h5>    \t<p>If you have a connection problem immediately after a Steam update, it is most likely being caused by a firewall.</p>    \t<p>The best solution is to go to the firewall permissions and remove all references to Steam.exe, HL.exe and HL2.exe and let them be relearned again. Just because there are existing permissions does NOT mean they are correct permissions. Every time the Steam client is updated, your firewall permissions need to be reset.</p>    \t<h5>Multiple Firewalls</h5>    \t<p>Never run more than one firewall program at a time while using Steam. They can conflict with each other and cause many different connection problems. Examples of running multiple firewalls include:</p>    \t<ul>  \t\t<li>Running the Windows firewall with your router&#39;s firewall simultaneously</li>  \t\t<li>Running the Windows firewall with Zone Alarm, Tiny Personal Firewall or some other third-party firewall application</li>  \t\t<li>Running the Windows firewall with your motherboard&#39;s built-in firewall (mainly an issue with nForce motherboards)</li>  \t</ul>    \t<p>After making any changes to your firewall, anti-virus or security software settings please <strong>EXIT STEAM AND RESTART</strong> before attempting to connect to a secure server. Once you have restarted you should be able to connect to VAC servers.</p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<h4 class="subheading">Peer Guardian</h4>    \t<p>Peer Guardian is not compatible with Steam. Please disable Peer Guardian before launching Steam to avoid connection issues.</p>  \t</li>  </ul>    <p><a name="background"></a></p>    <h4>Background Applications</h4>    <ul>  \t<li>  \t<h4 class="subheading">P2P, FTP and Web Server Applications</h4>    \t<p>Do not run Peer-to-Peer (P2P) programs like BitTorrent, Kazaa, eMule, LimeWire or Exeem in the background. These programs can consume large portions of your bandwidth. The same is true for FTP and Webserver applications such as Apache, MySQL servers and Microsoft&#39;s IIS services.</p>    \t<p>After exiting your Peer to Peer software please <strong>EXIT STEAM AND RESTART</strong> before attempting to connect to a secure server. Once you have restarted you should be able to connect to VAC servers.</p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<h4 class="subheading">Viruses, spyware and malware, netlimiting, anonymous IP masking programs</h4>    \t<p>Connection problems can also arise if your system is infected with a virus or spyware. We strongly recommend running virus checks while you are not using Steam if you suspect there is a virus or trojan on your system. For more information, please follow the <a href="kb_article.php?ref=6057-YLBN-1660" title="Spyware, Malware, Adware, and Viruses Interfering with Steam">Spyware, Malware, Adware, and Viruses Interfering with Steam</a> topic.</p>    \t<p>Programs like Cybersitter, Netlimiter, X-Fire and Stegnos Anonymous Internet can also interfere with normal Steam operations. Please disable these programs before launching Steam.</p>  \t</li>  </ul>    <p><a name="third"></a></p>    <h4>Third-party Anti-Cheat Applications</h4>    <p>Using third-party anti-cheat applications, both server and client-side, is not necessary and may result in the errors outlined above.

            '<div class="section" id="whatisvac">  <h3>What is VAC?</h3>    <p>VAC stands for Valve Anti-Cheat, an automated system designed to detect cheats installed on users\' computers. If a user connects to a VAC-Secured server from a computer with identifiable cheats installed, the VAC system will ban the user from playing that game on VAC-Secured servers in the future.</p>    <p>The VAC system reliably detects cheats using their cheat signatures. Any third-party modifications to a game designed to give one player an advantage over another is classified as a cheat or hack and will trigger a VAC ban. This includes modifications to a game\'s core executable files and dynamic link libraries.</p>    <p>While server admins may choose to ban specific players, server admins cannot VAC ban players.</p>    <p>The following will <i>not</i> trigger a VAC ban:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Using chat programs like X-Fire or Overwolf</li>  \t<li>System hardware configurations</li>  \t<li>Updated system drivers, such as video card drivers</li>  </ul>  </div>  &nbsp;  <div class="section" id="avoidvac">  <h3>How can I ensure I don\'t get VAC banned?</h3>    <p>To ensure your account does not get VAC banned, use only trusted machines to play on VAC-Secured servers. If you are not sure whether or not the machine you are using to connect to Steam may have cheats installed, do not play on VAC-Secured servers.</p>    <p>Use caution when installing any game modifications like scripts or custom skins, and only download custom content from trusted sources. Hackers may maliciously disguise their cheats to cause others to get banned.</p>    <p>For more information on how you can protect yourself and your account, please refer to our <a href="kb_article.php?ref=1266-OAFV-8478">Account Security Recommendations</a> FAQ.</p>    <p class="SteamChinaExclude">Additional information on Valve\'s policies can be found in our <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=subscriber_agreement" title="Steam Subscriber Agreement">Steam Subscriber Agreement</a>.</p>  <p class="SteamGlobalExclude">Additional information on Perfect World\'s policies can be found at <a href="https://store.steamchina.com/subscriber_agreement" title="Steam China Subscriber Agreement">Steam China Subscriber Agreement</a>.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="consequences">  <h3>If I\'m VAC banned what does it mean for my account?</h3>    <p>For detailed information on how VAC bans affect your account, please visit the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4044-qdhj-5691">I\'ve been VAC banned</a> FAQ.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="report">  <h3>How do I report a new cheat?</h3>    <p>If you know of a new cheat, especially private cheats (ones that aren\'t on a public website), and can provide the links or the actual binaries, please send an email with pertinent information to the following email address:</p>    <p><i><a href="mailto:vacreview@valvesoftware.com">vacreview [at] valvesoftware [dot] com</a></i></p>    <p>All emails are read and reviewed by the VAC development team.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="reportplayer">  <h3>How do I report a cheater?</h3>    <p>If you believe to have played with or against a cheater, please follow the instructions in the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1010-TOKN-8461">Reporting suspected cheaters</a> FAQ to report the suspected cheater.</p>    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Users are not VAC banned based on reports alone.

Server administrators may issue a Server ban, but these are not as severe as a VAC ban. We cannot prevent Server bans at Valve; whoever runs the server can ban players for any reason they desire.</p>    <p>If you find that you are banned from a large number of community servers you have likely been banned by a third-party ban tool, such as Steambans or Punkbuster. These third-party tools are used by a large number of servers sharing a common database of banned IDs. These tools are unrelated to Steam and we cannot assist you in resolving these issues.</p>    <p>You will not be banned by the VAC system unless you log in to a VAC-secure server with a cheat installed on your computer.</p>  </div>',

            '<p><a name="gifts-whatare"></a></p>    <h3>What is a Steam Gift?</h3>    <p>When you purchase a game on Steam, we offer the option to &ldquo;gift&rdquo; the item to anyone on your Steam friends list. The recipient will receive the gift as an attractive e-mail card with a personal message from you and instructions to redeem the game.</p>    <p>A Steam gift purchase is a one-time transfer&mdash;after the recipient has redeemed and installed the gift, it is now a part of his or her Steam games collection. Also note that you may only gift new purchases&mdash;you may not transfer games you already own. That&rsquo;d be like wrapping up and presenting the toaster you&rsquo;ve used every morning for the past year.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="gifts-purchase"></a></p>    <h3><span class="bold">How can I purchase Steam Gifts for a different Steam user?</span></h3>    <p>To give a gift to a friend or family member, locate the game you would like to gift on the Steam Storefront and then click the <span class="bold">&quot;Add to cart&quot;</span> button. Upon checking out, select the&nbsp;<span class="bold">&quot;Purchase as a gift&quot; </span>option to purchase the items in your cart for a friend.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="gifts-recipient"></a></p>    <h3><span class="bold">Selecting your gift recipient</span></h3>    <p>When you select the &quot;Purchase as a gift&quot;, you\'ll be presented with a list of your Steam friends, from there you can select who you\'d like to receive your gift.  If you\'d like to send it to someone who\'s not listed, you\'ll have to add them to your Steam friends list.  This helps ensure your gift is going to make it to the right person.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="gifts-delayed"></a></p>    <h3><span class="bold">How can I deliver the gift at a later date?</span></h3>    <p>After you\'ve chosen a friend to receive the gift, you can click the <span class="bold">&quot;Schedule delivery...&quot;</span> button to schedule the gift to be sent automatically on a future date.  When that time comes, we\'ll automatically send the gift to your friend and also send you an email letting you know your gift has been delivered.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px">      <tbody>      <tr>          <td style="padding: 15px;"><a name="gifts-message"></a>                <h3><span class="bold">Including a Special Message with your gift</span></h3>                <p>You may take a few moments to add a special message to the gift recipient. When they receive your gift, your special message will be displayed for them in Steam and they will also receive your gift message via e-mail.</p>          </td>          <td align="center" style="padding:10px;"><img alt="Gift Example" src="/images/faq/6262-QXCN-0755/gift_message_EN2.jpg" width="616" /></td>      </tr>      </tbody>  </table>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="gifts-sent"></a></p>    <h3><span class="bold">What happens after I purchase a gift?</span></h3>    <p>Your friend will receive an e-mail message, including your personalized gift message, notifying them that they have received a gift. Your friend will also receive a gift notification in the Steam client.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="gifts-received"></a></p>    <h3><span class="bold">How will I know whether my friend has received their gift?</span></h3>    <p>You can check the status of all your gifts on your <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/my/inventory/#753_1">Steam Inventory</a> page.  You can also access this from the Steam client - Within Steam, click on <span class="bold">&quot;Games&quot;</span> in the main menu, then select <span class="bold">&quot;Manage gifts and guest passes...&quot;</span>.</p>    <p>When your gift is sent to your friend, they\'ll have the option to accept or decline the gift.  Once they do, we\'ll send you an email letting you know.  If your friend takes no action on the gift, we\'ll automatically cancel the gift and issue you a refund after 30 days.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="gifts-use"></a></p>    <h3><span class="bold">How do activate a Steam gift that I received?</span></h3>    <p>If you do not already have Steam, download and install Steam <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">here</a>. Once you have Steam installed, you will be prompted to create an account or login to an existing Steam account. If you do not have an account, please create one.</p>    <p>1. You will receive an e-mail containing a link that will open Steam to redeem your gift or in the Steam client you will receive a notification at the top right corner that says you have a new gift as seen below:</p>    <p><img alt="New gift notification" class="faqimage" src="/images/faq/gifting/newgiftnotification.png" width="90%" /></p>    <p>2. Clicking on &quot;1 new gift&quot; will take you to the following screen where you must click either Accept Gift or Decline Gift. Once you click Accept Gift, the game will be added directly to your Library.</p>    <p><img alt="Gift received" class="faqimage" src="/images/faq/gifting/giftreceived.png" width="90%" /></p>    <p>If you click on Decline Gift, we\'ll issue a refund to the original sender.  You can optionally include a note when you choose to decline the gift; whether you do or not, we\'ll email the sender to let them know the gift was declined.</p>    <p>3. When you add the game to your Library it will be listed in your <span class="bold">Library &gt; Games</span> list in Steam, highlighting the game and clicking the &quot;Install&quot; will download the game to your computer.</p>    <p>If the game is already in your Library you will receive a notification that it is and you will not be able to add it.</p>    <p>If the game is not in your Library you will receive a pop-up notification confirming your actions, and if you have any duplicate games in a package you will be notified that you will not receive extra copies as seen below:</p>    <p><img alt="Extra copies" class="faqimage" src="/images/faq/gifting/extracopies.png" width="90%" /></p>    <p>If you attempt to add a game to your Library that requires additional games that you don\'t own you will receive an error message as well:</p>    <p><img alt="No base game" class="faqimage" src="/images/faq/gifting/nobasegame.png" width="90%" /></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h4>Gifting Questions</h4>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="expire"></a></p>    <h3><span class="bold">Do gifts expire if they are not redeemed in a certain amount of time?</span></h3>    <p>After a gift has been delivered to a friend, they have thirty days to accept the gift. Once the gift has been accepted, the game is permanently subscribed to the Steam account that it was redeemed on.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="howgift"></a></p>    <h3><span class="bold">How can I tell someone else how to give me a gift on Steam?</span></h3>    <p>To give a gift on Steam, your friend may simply <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/join/" title="Create a Steam Account">create a Steam account</a> online and then purchase a gift from the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" title="Steam Storefront">Steam store</a> as a gift.

            '<div class="section" id="mode">  <h3>Does Dota Plus work in every game mode?</h3>  <p>Dota Plus counts activity for Relics, Challenges, Hero Leveling, and Weekly Victories for any matches that have the same Hero picking rules as All Pick. For example, Random Draft mode counts, but Ability Draft, bot matches, and custom games do not.</p>    Turbo games grant half the normal hero xp for wins/losses.  </div>    <div class="section" id="cancelsub">  <h3>What happens if I cancel my subscription?</h3>  <p>Dota Plus will still be active until the end of your scheduled renewal date.

These will resume counting the next time you activate Dota Plus on the account. Any Hero sets you\'ve purchased from the Shard Shop are still available to you. All other features of Dota Plus are inaccessible after a subscription or membership lapses.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="stack">  <h3>Is it possible to stack subscription / membership time?</h3>  <p>Yes. If you have a recurring subscription with Dota Plus, applying additional time blocks (memberships) will apply to the account and push out your renewal date accordingly. If you have an active Dota Plus membership, applying additional memberships will push out the expiration date accordingly.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="gift">  <h3>Can I gift a friend Dota Plus?</h3>  <p>Yes! You can gift Dota Plus memberships to eligible friends under the “Gifting” menu in the Dota Plus purchase screen. <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?p_faqid=549">Gifting restrictions</a> do apply – you’ll be able to see if your friend is eligible in the purchase screen before making the purchase.</p>  </div>',

            "<p>There is always the potential that applications running on a machine might negatively affect the performance of Steam games or the Steam client. Certain applications can even lead to more serious issues such as connectivity losses and application crashes. If you are encountering poor performance, it may be necessary to investigate other applications on your machine and possibly disable them for testing purposes.</p>  <p>It is always a good idea to work with a specialist to help determine how these applications are setup on your machine, while also ensuring that nothing is interfering.</p>",
            "<h4>Identifying the Problem</h4>  <p>The types of applications you are using will affect your computer differently depending on what these applications are designed to do. The following list explains some of the more common types of applications, as well as what to look out for in terms of interfering behavior.</p>  <h5>Anti-virus Software</h5>  <p>Anti-virus software hooks very deep into user systems and can affect disk and network operations which will cause issues with Steam. Some games also use copy protection technology that can appear as malicious software to an AV scanner, resulting in potential false-positive alerts.</p>  <p>You'll want to ensure that your AV software is not interfering with Steam. You may also need to add exceptions for Steam and its games in your AV configuration.</p>    <h5>Virtual Private Network (VPN) Software</h5>  <p>VPN software has the potential of preventing the Steam client application from accessing the Steam network. If a game requires network capability, it may also interfere with that connection.</p>  <p>You'll want to ensure that your network is configured to allow the traffic of Steam and the games you are playing.</p>    <h5>Anti-Spyware Software</h5>  <p>Aggressive spyware detection software can block the Steam client from receiving updates or prevent connection to Steam content servers.</p>  <p>Certain Steam web features might also not function if your web traffic is being aggressively monitored by a anti-spyware or other web security applications</p>    <h5>Firewalls & Security Applications</h5>  <p>Certain firewalls and firewall configurations may prevent Steam from talking to its servers. It may be necessary to add exceptions in your firewalls for Steam if you discover that this is the cause.</p>    <h5>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Clients & File Sharing Software</h5>  <p>P2P programs have the potential to consume a large portion of your bandwidth or other system resources if not properly configured. This can prevent connections or traffic that Steam depends on, while also interfering with resources required by games. It is not recommended to have file sharing applications active while you are using Steam.</p>    <h5>FTP and Web Server Applications</h5>  <p>As with P2P programs, these programs are generally very bandwidth-intensive and have the potential generate issues with Steam. Examples include database, HTTP and many other types of dedicated server software.</p>    <h5>IP Filtering/Blocking Programs</h5>  <p>These types of programs are explicitly designed to limit what type of traffic is received and sent through your network. These are typically found in institutional and corporate networks, but can also be used on personal computers. These programs are known to cause issues with Steam and game connections.</p>    <h5>Download Accelerator and Download Manager Programs</h5>  <p>These programs curate your network experience, resulting in the possibility that Steam and game traffic may be hindered. Download accelerator programs should be disabled while using Steam.</p>    <h4>Disabling and Testing</h4>  <p>Issues related to any of these types of programs may be resolved by exiting and/or disabling the program and then exiting and restarting Steam. For certain applications, a system reboot may be required after you have shut down or disabled them.</p>    <h5>Hidden Processes</h5>  <p>Many applications are configured to launch when a computer starts. These might not even appear in the Windows task bar, but may still be among some of your active processes using your system's resources.</p>  <p>Because of the complexity of these systems and the expertise required to make changes to them, we recommend working with an expert to ensure that nothing damaging is done to your computer, while also ensuring that hardware, applications, security and network are all setup to work together without conflict.</p>",

            '<div class="important">  <p>Poor or reduced FPS can be caused by any number of factors, all of which are hard to diagnose without physically looking at your machine. Due to the number of unique hardware and software configurations, it\'s nearly impossible to provide detailed analysis and recommendations for each user.</p>  &nbsp  <p>The information in this article is written as a general guide for improving a game\'s performance. If the information does <i>not</i> help we recommend reaching out to a local PC technician or online discussions for help with improving your individual machine\'s performance.</p>  </div>  &nbsp  <div class="section" id="sysreq">  <h3>Check the game\'s system requirements</h3>  <p>The system requirements for all games are listed on the game\'s Store page. Simply meeting the system requirements does not mean you\'ll have high FPS or strong in-game performance. If your system does not meet or is slightly above the minimum requirements needed to run a game, you may need to upgrade the appropriate hardware, especially if your computer uses an integrated graphics card. Upgrading your video card and memory can have an immediate effect on gameplay performance.</p>  <p>As games update, new features may be added along with improvements to graphical fidelity and sound. This may cause games to no longer run as well as they used to on older hardware. In these situations, we can only recommend modifying your video settings or upgrading your hardware for improved performance.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="resources">  <h3>Manage your system\'s resources</h3>  <p>The amount of memory available (RAM) for model loading and graphics rendering has a direct effect on the rate at which frames are displayed in games, and whether or not lag is apparent while playing.</p>  <p>Below are some instructions to reduce the hard drive read times for loading game levels and content, prevent video display conflicts, and increase the available processor time and memory for games on your system. We have ordered these from most to least effective for increasing or maintaining your FPS:</p>  <ol>      <li><b>Disable background applications</b> - Running fewer processes in the background while playing a game may have an immediate impact on in-game performance. If you\'re noticing poor performance, we recommend removing unnecessary startup programs and manually stopping any unnecessary applications through your task manager (in Windows: CTRL+Shift+Esc, on a Mac: Command+Option+Esc). </li>      <li><b>Free up memory</b> - Be sure to have plenty of available RAM when running games. When a machine has insufficient RAM for game resources you will experience disk swapping, which will have a noticeable effect on FPS. 256 megabytes of RAM is the <i>minimum</i> amount of RAM required for most games. Model detail, water detail, HDR, and other video options enabled or increased will require a significantly greater amount of RAM to maintain a high FPS rate.</li>  \t<li><b>Video card software</b> - Any video card software for forcing particular video modes should be disabled. Please see the <a title="Refresh Rate and VSYNC" href="kb_article.php?ref=2989-WFLX-6244">Refresh rate and VSYNC</a> article for more information on managing your screen refresh rate.</li>  </ol>  </div>  &nbsp  <div class="section" id="drivers">  <h3>Update your various drivers</h3>  <p>Outdated drivers (CPU, GPU, and audio) may fail to make full use of your machine\'s capabilities, resulting in significantly reduced FPS. A good first step for improving game performance is to ensure you have the latest drivers for your various components. Please see the <a title="Updating Drivers" href="kb_article.php?ref=6416-EYDH-0477">Updating drivers</a> article for information.</p>   </div>    <div class="section" id="resolution">  <h3>Use an optimal resolution</h3>  <p>Increasing resolution, or any video option beyond your recommended settings will have an immediate negative impact on your FPS.</p>  <p>If you have changed or modified your video settings (and do not remember the original settings) you can reset them with the instructions provided in the <a title="Reset Video Settings and Force a Video Mode" href="kb_article.php?ref=1216-JMTZ-0860">Reset Video Settings and Force a Video Mode</a> article.</p>  <p>Valve games have support for auto-detecting your hardware and setting reasonable graphics settings. Please try using <i>-autoconfig</i> as a launch option as an initial troubleshooting step when trying to improve FPS. If the game launches and you have improved FPS, we recommend slowly modifying your video settings to find acceptable FPS. If you continue to make changes and notice a drop in FPS, you\'ll know you\'ve set your video settings too high for your hardware.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="videoset">  <h3>Modify your video settings</h3>  <p>Manually modifying your game\'s video options can increase your FPS, however, we do not provide support for this process at Steam Support. Each user\'s machine has unique capabilities and will run games differently - even at the same resolution.</p>  <p>It is recommended that you use the factory default settings for your video card if you encounter random freezes (but not crashes) while playing or while loading maps.</p>  <p>Please see the <a title="Reset Video Settings and Force a Video Mode" href="kb_article.php?ref=1216-JMTZ-0860">Reset Video Settings and Force a Video Mode</a> artcile for help if you are experiencing inadequate performance and would like to lower your video resolution and DirectX level (this may help with older video cards and integrated video cards) to improve game performance.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="integrated">  <h3>Using an integrated graphics card</h3>  <p>Many notebooks use integrated graphics cards for video processing. Integrated graphics cards are not as strong as dedicated graphics cards, and as a result players may experience lower in-game performance.</p>  <p>When running a system with an integrated graphics card, you should run the game in DirectX 8.1 mode with shader detail set to low and in windowed mode in order for the game to function properly. Please note, Source games do not support anything below DirectX 8.1. Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, and CS:GO do not support anything below DirectX 9.0. If you can not run the game in these minimum modes, your video card does not meet the minimum system requirements to run the game(s).</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="launchoptions">  <h3>Use launch options for Valve games</h3>  <p>Valve Source and Goldsrc games can make use of launch options to adjust detail levels and graphic rendering. Launch options are easily set parameters that can change the behavior of Steam applications when they are run. Please see the <span style="vertical-align: middle"><a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1040-JWMT-2947">Setting Game Launch Options</a></span> article for more information.</p>  </div>',

            '<a name="watch"></a>\t  <h4>Watching a Broadcast</h4>  <p>There are a number of ways to watch broadcasts throughout the Steam Community:</p>  <ul>  <li>Find public broadcasts on the community <a href=\'https://steamcommunity.com/?subsection=broadcasts\'>Broadcast</a> home page. Broadcasts are also available within each product\'s Community Hub.</li>  <li>You can watch your friends play by selecting <i>Watch Game</i> from the drop down next to friend\'s name in your friends list.</li>  <li>From a friend\'s profile - Below the <i>Currently In Game</i> text, select <i>Watch Game</i>.</li>  </ul>    <a name="setup"></a>\t\t  <h4>Setting up a Broadcast</h4>\t  <p>As soon as you start playing a game, your friends will be able to send you a request to watch.</p>  <h5>Broadcast Settings</h5>  <p>The first time a friend requests to watch your game, you\'ll be presented with Broadcasting settings. You can access these settings at any time from the broadcast tab of your  <i>Steam > Settings</i> inside the client:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>Broadcast is disabled</li>  \t<li>Friends can request to watch my games (default)</li>  \t<li>Friends can watch my games</li>  \t<li>Anyone can watch my games (public broadcast, can be found in the associated game hub)</li>  </ul>   <h5>Ending a Broadcast</h5>  <p>Exiting the game will end your broadcast. Alternatively, at any time you can press <i>Stop</i> from the Broadcast panel in the Steam Overlay (shift+tab).</p>  <h5>Inviting Friends</h5>  <p>You can invite friends to watch your game by selecting <i>Invite to Watch</i> from the drop down next to their name in the Friends List.</p>    \t<h5>What is recorded and included in my broadcast?</h5>  \t<p>Video:</p>  \t<p>By default, Steam will only broadcast video recorded from the game you are playing. If you switch to another program or your computer’s desktop and Steam is unable to record video from the game you are playing while it is not active/in focus, viewers will see a placeholder graphic until Steam can again record video from your game.</p>  \t<p>You can optionally enable recording video of applications outside of your game through the Steam Client settings menu. Please remember that your broadcast viewers will be able to see any open windows when enabled.</p>  \t<p>Audio:</p>  \t<p>By default, Steam will only record audio from the game you are currently playing. You can enable recording a microphone or all audio played through your computer\'s default output device through the Steam Client Settings.</p>    <a name="faq"></a>\t  <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>  \t  \t<li><a href="#18">What are the browser requirements for watching?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#3">What are the account requirements for broadcasting?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#7">What kind of content is allowed?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#8">How do I report a broadcast?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#12">How can I get my broadcast to show up in a game hub?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#13">How can I see who is watching my game?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#14">Can I save my broadcast?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#17">How do I change the bit rate, video dimensions, microphone, and desktop settings?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#19">What operating systems can I broadcast from?</a></li>  \t  \t  <p><a name="18"></a></p>  <h5>What are the browser requirements for watching?</h5>  <p>Steam Broadcasting is currently supported by the following browsers:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>Steam Client</li>  \t<li>Google Chrome (version 39+)</li>  \t<li>Apple Safari (version 8+ on OSX)</li>  \t<li>Internet Explorer (version 11 on Windows 8; not supported on other versions of Windows)</li>  \t<li>Mozilla Firefox (version 42+)</li>  </ul>  <p>The above do not apply for mobile devices. Steam broadcasts are not currently supported on iOS devices.</p>\t    <p><a name="3"></a></p>  <h5>What are the account requirements for broadcasting?</h5>  <p>Accounts that meet the following requirements are able to broadcast games:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>Have made a purchase on Steam and are therefore <a href=\'https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663\'>non-limited accounts</a></li>  \t<li>Are not currently Community Banned</li>  </ul>    <p><a name="7"></a></p>  <h5>What kind of content is restricted?</h5>  <p>As a Steam subscriber, you agree to abide by the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/">Steam Subscriber Agreement</a>, the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct/">Steam Online Conduct rules</a>, and the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810">Steam Community Rules and Guidelines</a>. You are responsible for the use of your Account and for all of the communication and activity on Steam that results from use of your Account. Your online conduct and interaction with other subscribers should be guided by common sense and basic etiquette.</p>    <p><a name="8"></a></p>  <h5>How do I report a broadcast?</h5>  <p>From the broadcast window/page, select &quot;Report Broadcast&quot;. When a broadcast is reported, Steam may save some or all of the broadcast for review.</p>    <p><a name="12"></a></p>  <h5>How can I get my broadcast to show up in a Game Hub?</h5>  <p>If you select &quot;Anyone can watch my game&quot; as your broadcast privacy setting then your broadcast will be visible in that Game Hub.</p>    <p><a name="13"></a></p>  <h5>How can I see who is watching my game?</h5>  <p>You\'ll receive a notification when a friend either requests to watch or starts watching your game. At any time you can see a list of viewers from the Steam overlay broadcast box, or if you\'re watching your own broadcast, from the top of the chat.</p>    <p><a name="14"></a></p>  <h5>Can I save my broadcast?</h5>  <p>No, broadcasts are currently live only. However, if a video is reported for review, Steam may save some or all of the broadcast for review.</p>    <p><a name="17"></a></p>  <h5>How do I change the bit rate, video dimensions, microphone, and desktop settings?</h5>  <p>For advanced Broadcast settings, access the Steam Client\'s Settings panel and select the Broadcast tab.</p>    <p><a name="19"></a></p>  <h5>What operating systems can I broadcast from?</h5>  <p>Steam Broadcasting is currently supported through the Steam Client on Windows 7, 8, and 10. Linux, OSX, and Windows Vista will be supported in the future.</p>    <a name="issues"></a>  <h4>Troubleshooting Broadcasting</h4>  <p>If you are constantly encountering issues with Broadcasting, it\'s possible that something is interfering and preventing the Broadcast from working as expected.</p>  <p>It\'s a good idea to investigate the topics below and make sure that the machine having Broadcasting issues is optimized for using the feature successfully.</p>  <p>Because some of these topics are advanced and may involve things outside of Steam, we highly recommend that you work with local IT support in your area to make sure that they are performed correctly.</p>    <h5>Restart Computer</h5>  <p>It\'s always a good first step to make sure that you restart Steam as well as your computer.</p>  <p>Restarting the computer flushes all kinds of system states and caches, while resetting other programs and releasing locks on files and other resources.</p>    <h5>Check Broadcast Settings</h5>  <p>Make sure that your Broadcast settings are what you expect.</p>  <p>You can access these settings at any time from the Broadcast tab of your <i>Steam > Settings</i> inside the Steam client</p>    <h5>Reinstall Steam</h5>  <p>The Steam installer can be downloaded <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">here</a> and reinstalled to the same location where it is already installed.</p>   <p>This will ensure that all files required by the Steam overlay are in a good state. This process will have no effect on your installed games.</p>   <p>WARNING! Uninstalling Steam will delete all game content.</p>    <h5>Refresh Local Network Hardware</h5>  <p>This includes restarting all modems & routers. Network hardware can get into slow or broken state after running for a long time. This can cause broadcast requests to take longer than normal, or to timeout completely.</p>  <p>If you are using a wireless network connection, you will want to bypass this with a direct Ethernet connection between your machine and network hardware.</p>     <h5>Test Online Connection</h5>  <p>Some Internet providers cache or compress online data to save bandwidth (especially cellphone networks). This can cause issues with Steam. It is a good idea to test the issue by connecting to an entirely different network, preferably from a different service provider.</p>    <h5>Investigate Firewalls</h5>  <p>Certain firewalls may prevent Steam features like Broadcasting from talking to servers. You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that the Firewall is not interfering. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes or add exceptions to your firewalls for Steam.</p>    <h5>Investigate Anti-Virus Software</h5>  <p>AV software hooks very deep into user systems and can affect disk and network operations which may cause issues with Steam. Some games also use copy protection technology that can appear as malicious software to an AV scanner, resulting in potential false-positive alerts.</p>   <p>You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that your AV software is not interfering with any Steam functionality. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes. It may also be necessary to add exceptions for Steam in your AV configuration,</p>  \t  <h5>Investigate Other Programs & Services</h5>  <p>Any software that modifies or monitors system, disk or network activity can cause issues while downloading or running a game. These programs and services can run in the background and are typically associated with software like Anti-Virus, ad-blockers, web-optimizers, firewalls, system cleaners, recording software, proxies, performance boosters etc.</p>   <p>You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that these services & programs are not interfering with Steam. You may even need to temporarily disable them for testing purposes.</p>  \t  <div class="important">  <h5>Have more questions or need help?</h5>  <p>Check out the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steambroadcasting/discussions">Steam Broadcasting Group Discussions</a> to read more and find out answers to other frequently asked questions.</p>  </div>  ',

            "<p>How do I update the system BIOS and chipset drivers for my motherboard?</p>",
            '<div class="important">  <h3>Important:</h3>  <p>Consult your Motherboard Manual Before Making Changes</p>  <p>Editing the system BIOS and motherboard settings improperly can result in system failure. Be sure to read your motherboard\'s manual thoroughly before attempting to flash your BIOS or update your motherboard\'s chipset drivers.</p>  <p>If you are not comfortable in performing the steps indicated by your motherboard\'s manual, please contact your motherboard manufacturer or system assembler for assistance.</p>  </div>  <p>It is important to keep the components on your motherboard in good working order, not just for playing games but for general system performance. The best way to accomplish this is to keep your motherboard\'s BIOS and chipset drivers up to date.</p>  <p>Many motherboard manufacturers release updates that resolve crucial issues related to system crashes and/or slow performance. This guide is intended to assist you in locating BIOS updates and chipset drivers to ensure that your system is in top working order.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h4>Update (Flash) Your BIOS</h4>  <p>The primary function of your system\'s BIOS is to recognize and initiate all of your system\'s hardware so it is ready to be used. &quot;Flashing&quot; the BIOS is synonymous with updating the motherboard\'s BIOS to the latest version. The often times requires a floppy drive to be installed on the system.</p>  <p>Please visit your motherboard manufacturer\'s website for instructions on how to check your BIOS version and for tools you can use to safely update your BIOS.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h4>Update Your Chipset Drivers</h4>  <p>Chipset drivers are responsible for controlling communication between various components in your system: the processor, the video card, the hard drives, PCI devices and system memory. Keeping these drivers up to date is important - especially if you are experiencing generally sluggish system performance.</p>  <p>Please visit your motherboard manufacturer\'s website to determine what type of chipset your motherboard has and where you can find the most recent drivers for it.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h4>nForce Motherboards</h4>  <p>Many motherboards use the Nvidia nForce platform for the chipset. Drivers are available directly from Nvidia, under nForce drivers:</p>  <p><a title="Nvidia drivers" href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</a></p>  <div class="note">  <h3>Note:</h3>  <p>While installing these drivers, you may be prompted to install the Nvidia Network Access Manager. We do not recommend installing that component because the Nvidia Network Access Manager has been known to cause issues with Steam.</p>  </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h4>Support from Your Motherboard Manufacturer</h4>  <p>Here is a partial list of motherboard manufacturers and their websites where you should be able to get information and assistance (you may need to search for your motherboard manufacturer\'s site if you cannot find it on the list below):</p>  <h4>A</h4>  <ul>      <li>Abit -

            "<p>DirectX and Shader Model Requirements for Games on Steam</p>",
            '<p>Pixel Shading is a method used for rendering advanced graphical features such as bump mapping and shadows. Most modern PC games utilize pixel shaders in conjunction with advanced GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) found on most Nvidia, AMD and certain Intel video cards. Pixel Shaders also directly correspond with Microsoft\'s DirectX platform.</p>  <p>It is extremely important to check each game\'s system requirements before deciding on making a purchase. If you are not sure what Pixel Shader level your video card can support, there is a chance that your video card will not be capable of running a game that requires an advanced Pixel Shader model - even if your card meets the minimum DirectX requirements.</p>  <p><span class="bold">General Guideline - DirectX Levels and Pixel Shader Versions:</span></p>  <ul>      <li>DirectX 8.0 - Pixel Shader 1.1</li>      <li>DirectX 8.1 - Pixel Shader 1.3 &amp; 1.4</li>      <li>DirectX 9.0 - Pixel Shader 2.0</li>      <li>DirectX 9.0c - Pixel Shader 3.0</li>      <li>DirectX 10.0 - Pixel Shader 4.0</li>      <li>DirectX 10.1 - Pixel Shader 4.1</li>      <li>DirectX 11.0 - Pixel Shader&nbsp;5.0</li>  </ul>  <p>Please follow our <a href="kb_article.php?ref=1510-QIJN-6861">DirectX Guide</a> to determine what version of DirectX you currently have installed and how to update DirectX.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h4>DirectX Hardware Support</h4>  <p>Please note that the version of DirectX that your video card supports can be misleading. You may be able to install the latest version of DirectX on your system, however there is distinct level of <span class="bold">hardware</span> DirectX support that must also be met in order for your video card to utilize Pixel Shader functions. Even with DirectX 9.0c installed, your video card may only be capable of supporting DirectX 7 due to the hardware limitation.</p>  <p>Below you will find detailed tables of video cards and what level of both DirectX and Pixel Shader Model are supported. Please use these tables to locate the video card you are using and then check the DirectX level of hardware support to compare with the system requirements of the games available on Steam. The DirectX level is listed on the right-hand side of the charts.</p>  <table>      <tbody>          <tr>              <td><b>Nvidia</b></td>              <td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_NVIDIA_Graphics_Processing_Units">Comparison of NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units</a></td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td><b>AMD</b></td>              <td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_AMD_Graphics_Processing_Units">Comparison of AMD Graphics Processing Units</a></td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td><b>Intel</b></td>              <td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_GMA">Intel GMA</a></td>          </tr>      </tbody>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Certain Intel video cards such as the Intel 945GM have a limitation in design that may result in issues when trying to run Source Engine games. The 3D graphics core does not support hardware transform and lighting and the similar vertex shader technologies, which is an important part of the 3D acceleration pipeline. Instead, this functionality is emulated in software which may reduce compatibility and performance with 3D games.</p>  <p>If you are experiencing crashing or slow performance with your Intel card and The Orange Box games (Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Portal and Team Fortress 2), then please try running the game and then typing this command in the console:</p>  <p><tt>mat_max_worldmesh_vertices 1024</tt></p>  <p>If that improves stability then please add it to your config file. Your config file can be located by right-clicking Team Fortress 2 in your Steam Library and selecting Properties, then click the Local Files tab, and click the "Browse Local Files" button.

There is an invite option within the <i>More</i> dropdown button near the top-right.</p>    <p>In order to reduce spam, group invites are limited to friends of the invitee.</p>    <h5>Requesting Access</h5>  <p>Users requesting access to restricted groups will be added to the group's pending request list.</p>   <p>To manage pending group requests, group owners (or officers/moderators if given permission) can find the <i>Manage Group Requests</i> page from their <i>Admin Tools</i> section on the right-hand side of the group page.</p>  <p>If someone has been denied entry into a group, the only way for them to join in the future is to receive an invite from a member who has invite permissions.</p>    <h5>Promoting Members</h5>  <p>There are four levels of membership within each group: Owner, Officer, Moderator and Member.</p>   <p>Each member type has its own unique privileges that can be changed by the group's owner:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>Login to your Steam Community Profile and navigate to your group homepage.</li>  \t<li>From the <i>Admin Tools</i> window at the right, select <i>Manage Group Members.</i></li>  \t<li>Clicking the star next to users will cycle between the various membership levels.</li>\t  </ul>    <h5>Kicking Members</h5>  <p>Members can be kicked from groups.

            '<div class="important">  <h3>Important:</h3>    <p>We encourage protecting your PC from viruses, spyware and other forms of malicious software. However, it is not necessary to run anti-virus and other security applications while you are engaged in playing a game on Steam.</p>    <p>Anti-virus applications often interfere with Steam and can cause a range of problems from connection issues to games not launching correctly. Please set your anti-virus to Game Mode or disable&nbsp;it before launching Steam if you are experiencing issues with your Steam games.</p>  </div>    <p>The Steam application or Steam&nbsp;game&nbsp;has been mistakenly identified as a virus or &quot;trojan&quot; by certain software as a result of the development of potentially-malicious programs which use the same filenames as valid Steam files (this is a very common practice amongst malicious software writers - many viruses already masquerade as valid operating system files).</p>    <p>We are working with the antivirus and firewall software vendors to ensure fewer false positives involving Steam appear in the future.</p>    <p>In the meantime, please review the symptoms below to determine whether or not this issue is impacting your system:</p>    <h4>McAfee AntiVirus</h4>    <p>McAfee AntiVirus incorrectly identifies some third party game files as malicious and will quarantine the files during the download process. This often results in the message &quot;This game is currently unavailable&quot; when trying to launch the game.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, most editions of McAfee AntiVirus have no way to exclude files from real-time scans, so the only work-around is to disable real-time scans. To do this, open McAfee and select &quot;Virus and Spyware Protection&quot;, then select the &quot;Real-Time Scanning&quot; option and click the button labelled &quot;Turn Off&quot;.</p>    <p>Once Real-time scanning is disabled, you can restore your game files by following the instructions to <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335">Verify Game Cache Files</a>.</p>    <p>Real-time scanning can be re-enabled once you are done playing, but unfortunately this will re-quarantine the game files, requiring this process to be repeated.</p>    <h4>ESET NOD32</h4>    <p>NOD32 incorrectly identifies some third party game files as malicious and will quarantine the files during the download process.&nbsp; This often results in the&nbsp; message &quot;This game is currently unavailable&quot; when trying to launch the game.&nbsp;</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Add your game folder to .&nbsp; The default folder location for third party games is C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common.&nbsp; Follow the link for further instructions: <a href="http://help.eset.com/eav/10/en-US/index.html?idh_config_exclude.htm">How do I exclude certain files or folders from real-time scanning?</a></li>  \t<li>Once your folder has been added, you need to verify your GCF cache files in order for the files to re-download.&nbsp; Please see the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335">Verifying GCF Cache Files</a> article for instructions.&nbsp;</li>  </ul>    <h4>Norton Firewall</h4>    <p>When using the &quot;Friends&quot; feature, some Norton Firewall users have reported that their firewall software reports that Steam may be malicious software attempting to access their system. This is a false positive.</p>    <p>Occasionally the Friends server sends your computer a message asking if you&#39;re still online - if you closed Steam (especially if you killed it from the task manager), this message can be intercepted by the Norton firewall.</p>    <p>Since Friends sometimes uses the same port number as a known trojan horse virus, the firewall incorrectly identifies the message as being malicious - despite the fact that the traffic does not mimic a trojan in any other respect.</p>    <h4>Kaspersky AV or Internet Security</h4>    <p>Kaspersky AV may prevent the in-game overlay from functioning in some or all games. This may occur silently, or Kaspersky may warn you that Steam is acting as an <span class="bold">Invader</span> application trying to load itself in another process.</p>    <p><span class="bold">Workaround:</span></p>    <p>In your Kaspersky settings go the Threads and exclusions, Trusted Zone, and add Steam.exe as a trusted application. Make sure you check the settings to <span class="bold">Do not restrict application activity</span> as well as <span class="bold">Do not scan opened files</span> for full compatibility.</p>    <p>Kaspersky 7.0 users must enable the <span class="bold">Compatibility Mode for Programs Using Self-Protection Methods</span> option, also disable the option for <span class="bold">Application Integrity Control</span>.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>  ',

            '<p>The Steam Cloud allows games and the platform to utilize cloud storage hosted by Steam. Games can utilize Steam Cloud for storage of many different types of data, including game settings, save games, profile stats and other user-specific bits. Many Steam client settings are also saved via the cloud, including collections, friend nicknames and anything changed via the Steam client Settings menu. These settings will persist on an account regardless of which machine it is logged into, as the settings are pulled from the cloud upon login.</p>  <ul>          <li><a href="#howto">How do I tell if a game uses Steam Cloud?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#enabling">How can I enable or disable The Steam Cloud?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#where">Where are cloud files stored locally?</a></li>\t  \t<li><a href="#log">Is there a log of Steam Cloud activity?</a></li>  </ul>  <h3>Issues & Troubleshooting</h3>  <p>Because of the automated nature of cloud synchronization, Steam Support has a limited ability to address issues with the cloud. If any saves or other data have been lost, it is not likely that we will be able to recover them.

            '<div class="section" id="howto">  <h4>How do I check if my game uses Steam Cloud?</h4>  <p>Developers are able to completely customize how The Steam Cloud is used for their games, including which user files are uploaded.</p>  <p>The Steam Storepage will show a Steam Cloud logo in the upper right if a game uses the Steam Cloud. But, you may need to work with the developer or the community to determine exactly which files or settings are integrated.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="enabling">  <h4>Enabling & Disabling The Steam Cloud</h4>  <p>The Steam Cloud can be toggled for individual games, or as a global Steam setting for all games. When Steam Cloud functionality of a game is disabled, all progress that would normally be saved via the cloud will only be saved locally on the machine where the progress was made.</p>  <p><h5>Individual games:</h5></p>  <ul>  \t<li>From the Steam Library, right click on any game and select <i>Properties</i>.</li>  \t<li>Under the <i>Update</i> tab, the Cloud Synchronization setting can be toggled.</li>  </ul>  <p><h5>All games:</h5></p>  <ul>  \t<li>From the Steam client Settings window, navigate to the <i>Cloud</i> tab.</li>  \t<li>Cloud can be enabled or disabled using the toggle next to <i>Enable Steam Cloud Sync</i>.</li>  </ul>  </div>    <div class="section" id="where">  <h4>Where are cloud files stored locally?</h4>  <p>Cloud files are stored locally in the following locations by default:</p>  <ul>  <li><b>PC:</b> C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata</li>  <li><b>Mac:</b> ~/Library/Application Support/Steam/userdata</li>  <li><b>Linux:</b> ~/.local/share/Steam/userdata</li>  </ul>  <h5>Game specific cloud files:</h5>  <p>The <i>userdata</i> folder will contain unique Steam IDs, which correspond to the Steam accounts that have logged in on that machine.</p>  <p>Within the Steam ID folders are the respective games associated with those Steam accounts, listed by appID. The following example is for Dota 2 (appID 570)</p>  <ul><li>Steam\\userdata\\[steamID]\\570\\</ul></li>  <h5>Steam client cloud files:</h5>  <p>Changes made to your Steam client settings are stored in the cloud, as well as locally in the following folder:</p>   <ul><li>Steam\\userdata\\[steamID]\\7\\</ul></li>  </div>    <div class="section" id="log">  <h4>Is there a log of Steam Cloud activity?</h4>  <p>Steam creates an log entry any time that files are written to the cloud or retrieved from it.</p>  <p>These are logged in the <i>cloud_log.txt</i> file, which is stored in the following location by default:</p>  <ul>  <li><b>PC:</b> C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\logs</li>  <li><b>Mac:</b> ~/Library/Application Support/Steam/logs</li>  <li><b>Linux:</b> ~/.local/share/Steam/logs</li>  </ul>  </div>    <div class="section" id="conflicts">  <h4>How do I resolve a Steam Cloud conflict?</h4>  <p><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/support/faq/cloud_conflict.JPG"></p>  <p>The Steam Cloud conflict window will be shown when a game is launched, if Steam detects that the local files associated with that game differ from the ones stored on the cloud.</p>  <p>This may have occurred on the machine you were using at the time that window was shown, or it may have occurred on another machine previously. Because the file was modified in two different locations without a synchronization between them, Steam cannot automatically pick which version of the file to keep.</p>  <p>You will most likely want to pick the version of the files that was modified most recently. This means you will have the progress made the last time you played the game. However, you would want to carefully consider how the times in the conflict window correspond to your behavior and progress within the game. This context will help you decide which files to select.</p>  <p>Note that playing games in Offline Mode will keep games from syncing until you\'ve gone back online, and this is very likely to cause a conflict.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="sync">  <h4>What if Steam is unable to sync files to the cloud?</h4>  <p><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/support/faq/cloud_sync.JPG"></p>  <p>This error indicates that Steam could not sync your local files to the Steam Cloud. It could be a temporary issue, or something could be wrong with your network that would need to be addressed.</p>  <p>Users are encouraged to address the underlying cause of the error prior to launching the game.</p>  <p>Ignoring the message and selecting "play game" could potentially cause a conflict between the cloud and your local files, resulting in lost data or progress.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="lostdata">  <h4>What if I lost a file or progress after moving to a different machine?</h4>  <p>If you are not seeing your most recent progress and you have double-checked that the game uses Steam Cloud on its store page, either Steam was not able to sync successfully with Steam Cloud before closing, or the sync resulted in a previous version of your data being uploaded to the cloud.</p>   <p>It’s possible that the original file or progress is still on the older machine, but was unable to sync. It may be possible to launch Steam from that machine and see if it will Sync the game. If that works, the progress should be available on the newer machine the next time you launch.</p>  <p>Also, many games do not use Steam cloud to store save games. The game developer will be able to help you find and transfer those files if you are using a new machine and still have access to the old one. If you no longer have access to the previous machine, those save game cannot be recovered.</p>   <p>Steam Support can provide further clarification on how the Cloud system works, but they cannot recover lost saves or assist in resolving cloud conflicts.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="crossplat">  <h4>What if I have an issue with cross-platform cloud data?</h4>  <p>Steam supports cross-platform integration of cloud data between different operating systems.</p>  <p>However, not all games make use of this feature. You would want to check with the community or the developer to confirm the details of cross-platform cloud integration.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="basic">  <h4>Steam Cloud Troubleshooting</h4>  <p>If you are continually experiencing issues with Steam cloud functionality, it\'s possible that something is interfering with the cloud or preventing it from working as expected.</p>  <p>It\'s a good idea to investigate each of the following scenarios to make sure that your machine is capable of using the cloud successfully.</p>  <p>Because some of these are advanced troubleshooting steps that involve areas outside of Steam, we highly recommend that you contact a local IT support specialist in your area to make sure that they are performed correctly.</p>    <h5>Refresh Local Network Hardware</h5>  \t<p>This includes restarting all modems & routers. Network hardware can get into slow/broken state after running for a long time. This can cause cloud sync to take longer than normal, or to fail completely.</p>  \t<p>If you are using a wireless network connection, you will want to bypass this with a direct Ethernet connection between your machine and network hardware.</p>     <h5>Test Online Connection</h5>  \t<p>Some Internet providers cache or compress online data to save bandwidth (especially cellphone networks). This can cause issues with Steam. It is a good idea to test the issue by connecting to an entirely different network, preferably from a different service provider.</p>    <h5>Investigate Firewalls</h5>  \t<p>Certain firewalls may prevent Steam from talking to its servers. You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that the Firewall is not interfering. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes or add exceptions to your firewalls for Steam.</p>    <h5>Investigate Anti-Virus Software</h5>  \t<p>AV software hooks very deep into user systems and can affect disk and network operations which may cause issues with Steam. Some games also use copy protection technology that can appear as malicious software to an AV scanner, resulting in potential false-positive alerts.</p>   \t<p>You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that your AV software is not interfering with Steam functionality. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes. It may also be necessary to add exceptions for Steam in your AV configuration (for example, excluding Steam cloud folders from live monitoring services).</p>  \t  <h5>Investigate Other Programs & Services</h5>  \t<p>Any software that modifies or monitors system, disk or network activity can cause issues while downloading or running a game. These programs and services can run in the background and are typically associated with software like Anti-Virus, ad-blockers, web-optimizers, firewalls, system cleaners, recording software, proxies, performance boosters etc.</p>   \t<p>You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that these services & programs are not interfering with Steam. You may even need to temporarily disable them for testing purposes.</p>  </div>',

            '<h4>How to setup Offline Mode</h4>  <p>Please follow the instructions below to successfully configure Offline Mode on your PC:</p>  <ol>      <li>Start Steam online - make sure the <span class="bold">"Remember my password"</span> box on the login window is checked.</li>      <li>Verify that all game files are completely updated.</li>      <li>Launch the game(s) you would like to play offline to verify that there are no further update or installation requirements.

It is for this reason that we encourage users to make sure they understand the behaviors that affect offline mode, so that issues can be avoided.</p>  <p>Also keep in mind that while in Offline Mode, Steam and your games will not receive important updates. It\'s always a good idea to go online to update the Steam client as well as your games.</p>  \t<ul>  \t\t<li><h5>Losing stored information</h5>  \t\t\t<p>Stored information is required for offline mode to function correctly. To prevent this information from being lost, make sure that you manually close Steam before shutting your computer down. Don\'t force quit Steam either.</p>  \t\t\t<p>You\'ll also want to make sure that you don\'t have any <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9828-SFLZ-9289">interfering programs</a> affecting Steam or its installation files.</p>  \t\t<li><h5>Network settings</h5>  \t\t\t<p>Firewall settings may prevent the Steam client and games from updating. Please see the <a title="Troubleshooting Network Connectivity" href="/kb_article.php?ref=1456-EUDN-2493">Troubleshooting Network Connectivity</a> FAQ for further instructions.</p>  \t\t<li><h5>Initial game start-up</h5>  \t\t\t<p>Most games require an initial start-up while connected to the Steam Network before they will work in offline mode.  If your game\'s status is &quot;100% - Ready&quot;, but you receive the message &quot;This game cannot be started in Offline Mode&quot; when attempting to play offline, the Steam client and/or game files need to be updated.</p>  \t\t<li><h5>Game requirements</h5>  \t\t\t<p>Games that require an active connection or use an external launcher will not work in offline mode.<p>  \t</ul>',

Once the codes have been purchased and activated through the retailer, scammers ask the victims to scratch the codes and read them over the phone.</p>    <p>Please be aware that Steam Wallet Gift Cards can only be activated on Steam. The associated value can only be used to purchase products such as video games, in-game items, software, and hardware.

            '<div class="section" id="whyban">  <h3>Why was I VAC banned?</h3>  <p>VAC bans are applied when an account, or an account using the phone number tied to other accounts, connects to a VAC-secured server while running cheat software.</p>   <p>Valve Anti-Cheat regularly checks the game files of all users connected to Valve\'s servers to ensure third party software is not being used which gives players an advantage. If software of this kind is detected a VAC ban will be issued.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="reason">  <h3>Can you tell me what program or software caused my VAC ban?</h3>  <p>No. We do not disclose the cheats that were detected while connected to a VAC-secured server that resulted in a VAC ban. We have detailed records for each VAC ban, however, releasing this information would only benefit cheat developers. The VAC team regularly investigates claims of false VAC bans to increase the effectiveness of Valve Anti-Cheat.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="appeal">  <h3>Can I appeal my VAC ban?</h3>  <p>No. VAC bans cannot be appealed. If a VAC ban is issued incorrectly it will be automatically removed after investigation, but Steam Support does not manually remove VAC bans applied to accounts for any reason.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="compromised">  <h3>I was not using my account when it was VAC banned. Can the ban be removed?</h3>  <p>No. Regardless of who was using the account at the time of the infraction, VAC bans are permanent and will not be removed. While we understand this can be frustrating, we must maintain a zero tolerance policy for cheating to foster a fair game that all players will enjoy.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="othergame">  <h3>The software I was using was a cheat, but not for a VAC-secured game. Can I disable the software and remove the ban?</h3>  <p>No. We are aware that cheat software exists for single player and offline games, but VAC bans are only issued when software provides an advantage on VAC-secured servers. While we understand this can be frustrating, we must maintain a zero tolerance policy for cheating to foster a fair game that all players will enjoy.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="application">  <h3>What games am I VAC banned from?</h3>  <p>To see which games your VAC ban affects, please launch Steam and go to <i>Steam</i> &gt; <i>Settings</i> &gt; <i>Account tab</i> &gt; select <i>&quot;Click here for details&quot;</i> under VAC Status.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="eligible">  <h3>What games can I play if I have been VAC banned?</h3>  <p>VAC banned accounts can still play single-player games, local LAN games, and multiplayer on non VAC-secured game servers. To find non VAC-secured servers, from the Steam main menu click on <i>View</i>, select <i>Servers</i>, then select <i>Not secure</i> in the Anti-cheat dropdown.</p>  <p>Cheating in one of the following Source games or a Source mod will result in a VAC ban for all games in the list below:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Counter-Strike: Source</li>  \t<li>Half-Life 2: Deathmatch</li>  \t<li>Day of Defeat: Source</li>  \t<li>Team Fortress 2</li>  </ul>    <p>Similarly, cheating in one of the following Gold Source games will result in a VAC ban for all games in the list below:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Counter-Strike</li>  \t<li>Condition Zero</li>  \t<li>Ricochet</li>  \t<li>Day of Defeat</li>  \t<li>Team Fortress Classic</li>  \t<li>Half-Life: Deathmatch</li>  \t<li>Deathmatch Classic</li>  </ul>  &nbsp;  </div>    <div class="section" id="phone">  <h3>How do VAC bans relate to phone numbers?</h3>  <p>VAC bans are applied to all accounts sharing a phone number at the time of the infraction. For this (and many other) reasons we do not recommend sharing your phone number or using another user\'s phone number on your Steam account. Accounts sharing the phone number that do not own the game the VAC ban is for will still receive a VAC ban and will not be able to purchase the game moving forward.</p>  <p>There are no restrictions placed on phone numbers that were on an account when the account was VAC banned; phone numbers can immediately be used on new accounts.</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is not enabled for all games and is used at the discretion of the developer.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="items">  <h3>Can I move my items and games to a different Steam account?</h3>  <p>No. Items and games cannot be moved from a VAC banned account to a different account, however, new games can still be purchased and registered on a VAC banned account and the account can still receive items, but not send them.</p>   <p>To prevent additional bans on your account, please remove all cheat software from your computer before playing on VAC-secured servers. If you do not know how or where the cheats were installed, you may want to consider reformatting your hard drive(s) and starting over with a fresh installation of your operating system.</p>  </div>    <div class="section SteamChinaExclude" id="contenthubs">  <h3>Can I upload content to game hubs if I have been VAC Banned?</h3>  <p>No. You cannot upload new content, such as guides and artwork, to a game hub if you have been VAC banned from that game.</p>  </div>    <div class="section SteamChinaExclude" id="voting">  <h3>Can I vote on Steam Workshop content in the game I have been VAC banned from?</h3>  <p>No. VAC bans prevent voting within the game where the VAC ban occurred. VAC bans on an account also prevent voting in Free to Play games and their communities.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="gifts">  <h3>Does my VAC ban affect my ability to send games as gifts?</h3>  <p>Yes. VAC banned accounts cannot send the game they\'ve been VAC banned in as a gift to other Steam accounts in the future. Similarly, if you gift a VAC-enabled game to an account and the giftee\'s account is VAC banned you will not be able to gift that game in the future.</p>  </div>',

This will allow other computers to reliably find your server when connecting to the router.</p>  <p>The only way to get an external static IP is to pay for one through your internet service provider. A static IP is important if you plan on having your server run all of the time. Using a static IP makes it easy for return players to find your server. Your current external IP address can be found below:</p>  <p><img src="http://www.danasoft.com/sig/no_whining.jpg" alt="Your External IP Address!" /></p>  <p>An internal IP address behaves just like an external IP address with the notable exception of only being visible from behind your router. You must use a static IP internally. Your router will forward ports for incoming connections to a specific IP address. If you have your IP setup dynamically, it will not necessarily forward the ports to your server.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h4>Setting Up a Static IP in Windows XP</h4>  <ol>      <li>Go to <span class="bold">Start</span> &gt; <span class="bold">Run</span> and type in: <tt>cmd</tt> to open a command prompt.</li>      <li>Type into the command prompt: <tt>ipconfig/all</tt>.<br />      You will see something similar to this:      <p>Windows IP Configuration <br />      <br />      Host Name . . . . . . . . . . . . : MYCOMP<br />      Primary Dns Suffix . . . . . . . :<br />      Node Type . . . . . . . . . . . . : Unknown<br />      IP Routing Enabled. . . . . . . . : No<br />      WINS Proxy Enabled. . . . . . . . : No <br />      <br />      Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection: <br />      <br />      Connection-specific DNS Suffix . :<br />      Description . . . . . . . . . . . : Realtek RTL8139/810x Family Fast Ethernet NIC<br />      Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : 00-80-F6-6A-21-E0<br />      Dhcp Enabled. . . . . . . . . . . : Yes<br />      IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.100<br />      Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0<br />      Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1<br />      DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx<br />      xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx<br />      NetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Disabled</p>      </li>      <li>Copy down:      <ul>          <li>IP address</li>          <li>Subnet mask</li>          <li>Default gateway</li>          <li>DNS Servers</li>      </ul>      </li>      <li>Right-click on <span class="bold">My network places</span> and go to <span class="bold">Properties</span>.</li>      <li>Right-click on <span class="bold">Local Area Connection</span> and go to <span class="bold">Properties</span>.</li>      <li>Select <span class="bold">Internet Protocol(TCP/IP)</span> and click on the <span class="bold">Properties</span> button.</li>      <li>Select the &quot;Use the following IP address&quot; option and fill in the fields with the respective information you copied out of your IPConfig.</li>      <li>Click <span class="bold">OK</span> and exit the network connection page.</li>  </ol>  <p>Test your internet connection to ensure that you are still able to access the internet.

            '<h4>HLDS and SRCDS Server Rate Tuning</h4> <p>There are three types of servers in Half-life and Source Games:</p> <ul>     <li>     <h5>Listen Server</h5>     <ul>         <li>A listen server is launched within the game you wish to play.</li>         <li>It has a minimal control panel.</li>         <li>A listen server requires the Steam Client and your game to be running.</li>         <li>All the stock game content is contained in a single cache file.</li>     </ul>     </li>     <li>     <h5>Client HLDS Server</h5>     <p>The HLDS Server is available from the <span class="bold">Tools </span>menu.</p>     <ul>         <li>Players must connect to it from LAN or over the internet. (You cannot play from the same computer as is hosting the game.)</li>         <li>The HLDS server requires Steam Client to always be running.</li>         <li>It has a full server control panel.</li>         <li>All the stock game content is contained in a single cache file.</li>     </ul>     </li>     <li>     <h5>Stand-Alone HLDS_1120 Server or Source Dedicated Server</h5>     <ul>         <li>Stand-alone servers are independent from Steam.</li>         <li>It does not require Steam client to be running.</li>         <li>Players must connect to it from a LAN or over the internet. (You cannot play from the same computer as is hosting the game.)</li>         <li>There are no cache files, all game content and resources are unpacked.</li>         <li>Source Servers must be installed in separate folders from HLDS Servers.</li>     </ul>     </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Optimizing Server Priority</h4> <p>When running a Server under Win32, the default is to run the Server at <span class="bold">normal </span>priority.</p> <p>Priority is basically a setting that tells the operating system what tasks to service first and for how long. Servers are very real-time applications and players are very sensitive to lag. Running your Server at normal priority can cause unpleasent lag. The solution is to run your server at <span class="bold">High </span>priority.</p> <p>WindowsXP assigns every program and process running on your PC a priority which determines the relative amount of CPU time that it gets compared to other programs. XP offers several settings: <span class="bold">Realtime, High, AboveNormal, Normal, BelowNormal and Low </span>.</p> <div class="warning"> <h3>Warning:</h3> <p><span class="bold">Realtime</span> is not recommended since it competes with the device drivers and can cause instability.</p> </div> <p>Most programs are assigned the <span class="bold">Normal</span> priority, but using the <span class="bold">Task Manager</span> you can change the priorities assigned to any process or program.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Instructions</h4> <p>To manually change the priority of a running program or process:</p> <ol>     <li>Open your Task Manager by pressing <span class="bold">Ctrl+Alt+Del </span>then clicking on the <span class="bold">Task Manager </span>button.</li>     <li>Click on the <span class="bold">Processes </span>tab.</li>     <li>Right-click on the program or process whose priority you want to change then highlight <span class="bold">Set Priority </span>and choose the priority for the program.</li> </ol> <div class="note"> <h3>Note:</h3> <p>When you assign a new priority to a process or program, the new priority setting only lasts as long as the program or process is continuously running. The next time you launch the program, it will default to the priority assigned by Windows.</p> <p>If you wish to launch your HLDS at high priority every time, you must use a batch file.</p> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Steam_HLDS.bat</h4> <p>Here is an example .bat file that runs a Half-Life Deathmatch server.</p> <p><a title="Steam_HLDS.bat" href="/downloads/5386-HMJI-5162/Steam_HLDS.bat">Download Steam_HLDS.bat</a></p> <p>Inside the file it looks like this:</p> <p>c:<br /> cd c:\\HLServer<br /> start /high c:\\HLServer\\hlds.exe -game valve -port 27015 +maxplayers 9</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Here\'s a breakdown of the commands:</p> <p><span class="bold">cd c:\\HLServer </span>- Changes the directory to the directory where the server is installed.</p> <p><span class="bold">-game valve </span>- Specifies the game, in this case Half-Life Deathmatch.</p> <p><span class="bold">-port 27015 </span>- Sets the port which the server will accept connections through (port 27015 will be used by default if no port is specified)</p> <p><span class="bold">+maxplayers 9 </span>- Sets the maximum number of players the server will accept to nine.</p> <div class="note"> <h3>Note</h3> <p>Source Dedicated Servers (SRCDS.EXE) should be run at <span class="bold">AboveNormal</span> priority not at <span class="bold">High</span>.</p> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5>Example</h5> <p><span class="bold">c:<br /> cd c:\\HL2Server<br /> start /high c:\\HL2Server\\srcds.exe -game hl2dm -port 27015 -ip xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx +maxplayers 9 </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Determining Optimal Maxplayers</h4> <p>The maxplayers setting should be optimized related to your uplink connection. If you are unsure of your uplink connection speed, go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dslreports.com/">www.dslreports.com</a> and run the free speed test.</p> <p>You will see two numbers, download and upload (or uplink).</p> <p>Download is how fast you can get data to the server. Upload/uplink is how fast the server can send data out to players.</p> <p>Basically for internet connections (bits/second):</p> <ul>     <li>128k uplink = 4 players (2 players for srcds)</li>     <li>256k uplink = 7 players (4 players for srcds)</li>     <li>320k uplink = 9 players (6 players for srcds)</li>     <li>512k uplink = 14 players (9 players for srcds)</li>     <li>768k uplink = 21 players (14 players for srcds)</li>     <li>1024k uplink = 28 player (19 players for srcds - note 16 players is max for HL2DM)</li>     <li>1140k uplink = 32 players (max for HLDS) (21 players for CS:S)</li>     <li>1708k uplink = 32 players for CS:S (max)</li> </ul> <p>Your particular optimal setting may vary depending on your connection. Local players on LAN are not included in this count.</p> <p>A good rule for HLDS is <span class="bold">35.6Kbits per player </span>.</p> <p>A good rule for SRCDS (Source Games) is <span class="bold">53.4KBits per player </span>(about 1.5x more than HLDM).</p> <p>Certain maps and MODs may take more uplink bandwidth.</p> <p>This maxplayers setting also assumes you are running the following server rate limits (in the server.cfg file):</p> <p><span class="bold">//minimum rate allowed<br /> // use 5000 for SRCDS Servers<br /> sv_minrate 3500<br /> <br /> // no limit on maxrate for LAN only use 7500 for regular server<br /> // this controls how fast maps can be downloaded by clients<br /> //sv_maxrate 0 = unlimited<br /> // Use 9999 for SRCDS servers<br /> sv_maxrate 7500<br /> <br /> // this is the minimum playable updaterate, leave this at 13<br /> sv_minupdaterate 13<br /> <br /> // 60 for updaterate is LAN ONLY use 13 for internet<br /> // 20 is default but will cut the maxplayers you can handle in 1/2<br /> // for SRCDS Servers use 30 - you might be able to use 20<br /> // sv_maxupdaterate 60<br /> sv_maxupdaterate 13 </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Testing Server Rates</h4> <p>You can use the following set of alias parameters to test your server rate quickly.<br /> Put these in your server.cfg file:</p> <p><span class="bold">//echo *** Adding Server RATE Alias\' *** <br /> alias dslow sv_minrate 2500;sv_maxrate 2500;sv_minupdaterate 5;sv_maxupdaterate 5;echo dead slow <br /> alias vslow sv_minrate 3500;sv_maxrate 3500;sv_minupdaterate 13;sv_maxupdaterate 13;echo very slow <br /> alias slow sv_minrate 3500;sv_maxrate 5000;sv_minupdaterate 14;sv_maxupdaterate 14;echo slow <br /> alias norm sv_minrate 3500;sv_maxrate 7500;sv_minupdaterate 15;sv_maxupdaterate 15;echo normal <br /> alias fast sv_minrate 3500;sv_maxrate 9999;sv_minupdaterate 20;sv_maxupdaterate 20;echo fast <br /> alias vfast sv_minrate 3500;sv_maxrate 20000;sv_minupdaterate 20;sv_maxupdaterate 60;echo LAN fast <br /> <br /> // quick display of all the current settings<br /> alias rates sv_minrate;sv_maxrate;sv_minupdaterate;sv_maxupdaterate </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Example Server.cfg Files</h4> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5>Generic server.cfg for CS:S Servers</h5> <p><a title="cs_server_cfg_file.cfg" href="/downloads/5386-HMJI-5162/cs_server_cfg_file.cfg">Download cs_server_cfg_file.cfg</a> (must be renamed to server.cfg for use)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Generic server.cfg for HL2DM Servers</h4> <p><a title="hl2dm_server_cfg_file.cfg" href="/downloads/5386-HMJI-5162/hl2dm_server_cfg_file.cfg">Download hl2dm_server_cfg_file.cfg</a> (must be renamed to server.cfg for use)</p> <p>server.cfg files for SRCDS are placed in the CFG folder for each Game Type.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Server FPS Control</h4> <p>HLDS Servers render frames independently from the Client.</p> <p>HLDS Servers use the CVAR <strong>sys_ticrate</strong> to control how many frames per second are rendered.</p> <p>SRCDS Servers use the CVAR <strong>fps_max</strong> to control how many frames per second are rendered.</p> <p>Why do you need to control this?</p> <p>There are two good reasons for you to manage the server FPS. The number one reason is loading on your Server CPU. The higher the FPS the higher the load. If you are getting more than 50% CPU utilization with your current FPS settings, you are either running too many players or you have the FPS set too high.</p> <p>HLDS Servers start with a default of 60FPS and can easily run up to 1000FPS (sys_ticrate 1000)</p> <p>SRCDS Servers start with a default of 300FPS&nbsp;but can also run up to 1000FPS, though that framerate&nbsp;will require a substantially higher performance CPU.</p> <p>Win32 Servers should be run on WIN2K / XP Pro platforms with HLDS on a 1.8GHz cpu and a minimum of 512MB of RAM and SRCDS Servers should be run on 2.2GHz CPUs minimum with 512MB of RAM.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>FPS Boost</h4> <p>Unfortunately, both of these servers will not achieve these FPS settings on a Win32 platform without one tweak. In order for the server to get service from the operating system, there must be a <span class="bold">high-resolution timer </span>running. Normally, the operating system runs a low resolution timer that is only good for a max of maybe 100FPS.</p> <p>Running Media Player (you need not play a file, just have it sitting there open) will force the operating system to use a high-res times that will give your server the capability of running up to 1000FPS. Media Player requires about 5MB while in idle, so it offers relatively low overhead for this improvement. You can also run a Macromedia SWF file in Internet Explore and it will do the same thing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Intel vs. AMD CPUs</h4> <p>If you set sys_ticrate (HLDS) or fps_max (SRCDS) to 1000, most Intel CPUs running on Intel chipsets will run the full 1000fps (plus or minus a few). AMD CPUs and Intel CPUs on non Intel motherboard chipsets may only run at 500FPS with a setting of 1000.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>WHY HIGHER FPS?</h4> <p>The key reason to run higher FPS is the render time. At 1000FPS, the server is rendering one frame every 1 millisecond (ms). This means that the worst-case adder to the player ping is only 1ms, IE: the player gets more accurate data and can get it more often.</p> <p>At 300FPS it\'s only 3ms which is perfectly acceptable, but at 100FPS it\'s 10ms, which is a significant percentage of a 100 ping (10%). A player with a 100 ping would actually be getting 110ms response time from the server. Many AMD systems will only run 60FPS without the ping booster which is 17ms.</p> <p>This is still not too significant but it can change the feel and response time of your server for players.</p> <p>Without the FPS Boost your server will use significantly less CPU but accuracy may suffer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>',

            "",
            "<h4>Check the Connection</h4>    \t<p>Sometimes these types of errors are just a small oversight. Plugging your mic into the right port on your sound card can sometimes be confusing or easily mistaken when you're in a rush. Most analog mic connections are pink and belong in the corresponding pink connector on your sound device. Some devices aren't color coded, and that's when it is time to consult the manual for your sound device to be absolutely sure your mic is plugged into the right port. Checking this problem first may save you hours of troubleshooting.</p>    <h5>USB Mics</h5>    \t<p>Try swapping ports. If you're using a USB port on the front of your case, switch it to one of the ones in the back. If you're using a USB hub, try bypassing the hub and see if that makes any difference. You may be able to track down the issue a lot faster this way.</p>    <h4>Check your drivers</h4>    \t<p>This applies to both your mic (if you're using a USB one) and your sound device. Sound device drivers are crucial, especially if you are running Windows Vista. Check the manufacturer of your sound device (such as Realtek, Creative, SigmaTel, etc) and visit their website for driver updates. If you're not sure where to find this information, check your motherboard's manual (for on-board sound) and/or consult the manufacturer of your PC.</p>    <h4>Checking the Mic settings in the game</h4>    \t<p>So, you've made sure that your mic is correctly connected, properly configured in Windows and it has passed the device test. The next thing to look at is the mic settings in-game. Below is an example of the configuration menu:</p>    \t<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/voice_chat_settings.PNG\" /></p>    \t<p>You can check to see if you can hear your mic is working by going to Steam Friends & Chat and selecting the gear icon in the upper right and then selecting Voice. From there you can use the button &quot;Start Microphone Test&quot; to test your mic settings (expect echoes if you don't have earphones!)</p>    \t<p>If it works, go ahead and test it in-game.&nbsp; Make sure you have the correct &quot;Voice Transmission Type&quot; selected. If using &quot;Push to Talk&quot; make sure your voice key is correctly bound to the right of &quot;Push-to-talk hotkey assigned as&quot;.</p>    \t<p>If&nbsp;it isn't working&nbsp;in-game,&nbsp;then the issue is probably that the mic input is being switched when you launch the game.</p>    \t<p>One last thing to keep in mind is that the Server can control if your mic is allowed to work at all, as well as what codec and sound quality is used. If you have everything configured properly and your mic still doesn't seem to work in-game, always try several different servers to make sure it isn't just a Server issue.</p>    \t<p>Note: Your microphone will not work while you are in Spectator mode.</p>      <h4>Bad Voice Quality</h4>    \t<p>Bad voice quality can stem from a few different causes. Below are some examples of situations where the quality is affecting the voice chat in-game:</p>    <h5>Feedback/Echoing</h5>    \t<p>Normally feedback will occur if you have your speakers cranked while using the mic. It is recommended that you use a headset with earphones so that your communication is clear to other players. Certain low-grade microphones are omni-directional, meaning they will pick up sounds from all directions - including your stereo/surround speakers. Turn your audio devices down and see if your voice quality improves.</p>    <h5>Low Volume</h5>    \t<p>Certain microphones need a boost. This can be configured by checking the Windows mic settings.</p>    <h5>Crackling/Distortion</h5>    \t<p>Many times bad voice quality is due to a faulty cable or a bad connection. Check the connection of your mic to your PC. If the connection is loose, it may be the reason why your voice quality is not clear. If you experience the same issue in other applications, you may want to consider getting a different mic to test with. Inexpensive, low-grade mics have often times been shunned on quality to keep the price low.</p>    \t<p>Also, make sure the mic is not too close to your mouth. If it is touching your face or lips as you use it, put it away so that it is about 1&quot; away from your mouth. If there's no windscreen on the mic itself, try moving it even further away.</p>      <h4>Effective Troubleshooting</h4>  \t<p>To effectively troubleshoot any technical issue, it's good to have a plan to consistently narrow down the potential cause with each step taken. A system that should be applicable to many cases follows, but make sure that you tailor it to your specific problem and setup:</p>  \t<ol>  \t    <li>Take steps to determine if the problem is hardware or software.</li>  \t    <li>Determine if the problem is universal, or unique to a specific situation.</li>  \t    <li>Check to make sure that all settings are inherited correctly. Is your operating system using the correct device? If applicable (if the game uses Steam voice systems) is Steam using the correct device? Do the game's settings reflect the correct device?</li>  \t</ol>  \t<p>As a basic starting place, answering these questions should help direct your troubleshooting efforts.</p>",

            "<p>The Steam community overlay is an in-game interface that allows access to many Steam Community features while playing games. The default keybind of Shift+Tab will open the overlay in any game where it is supported and enabled.</p>  \t  \t<p>Beyond giving access to Steam community features, many games utilize the overlay in the background to support in-game features that require Steam. You may not even realize that a game is using the overlay in these cases.</p>   \t  \t<p>Because the Steam overlay is a customizable Steamworks feature, games will use it differently depending on which features it supports and how the developer incorporated it. More detailed information can be found in the Steam community or by contacting specific game developers.</p>",
            '<h4>What can the overlay be used for?</h4>  \t<ul>  \t\t<li><span style="font-weight: bold">In-game purchasing</span>  \t\t<p>If a game offers micro-transactions, item purchases, or any other type of in-game purchasing, the Steam overlay will be required. The overlay enables the game to communicate with Steam and allow your purchase to be made while playing.</p></li>  \t\t  \t\t<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Friend, game & group invites</span>  \t\t<p>You can access your friends list, Steam chat, as well as group/game invites while in the overlay. Some games utilize the overlay for party and matchmaking invites. If it is not enabled, the invites will not work.</p></li>  \t\t  \t\t<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Screenshots</span>  \t\t<p>Steam allows screenshots to be captured in-game by using the default keybinding of F12. This feature requires the overlay to capture the screenshots. The screenshots can be accessed in-game by using the overlay as well.</p></li>  \t\t  \t\t<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Trading & Market features</span>  \t\t<p>Many games with in-game inventory systems will use the overlay to allow players access to inventory features while in the game. If a game supports trading or market purchasing while in-game, the Steam overlay will be required.</p></li>  \t\t  \t\t<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Other community features</span>   \t\t<p>The overlay interface gives access to most other features that are available through the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam website</a>. Along with access to these features specifically, the overlay has a built in web browser.</p></li>  \t\t  \t\t</ul>  <h4>Common Issues</h4>    \t\t<h5>Overlay Not Opening</h5>  \t\t<p>The overlay interface does not open when pressing its default shortcut (Shift+Tab).</p>   \t\t<p>The first thing you\'ll want to do is make sure that the Overlay is actually enabled and that your keybinding is correct. Specific instructions can be found below.</p>  \t\t<p>If the overlay is still not opening, make sure to follow all the Basic and Advanced steps in this article.</p>  \t\t</li>  \t\t  \t\t<h5>Overlay Freezes or Becomes Unresponsive</h5>  \t\t<p>Because the overlay is a supplemental component of the game you are playing, it will be automatically closed should your system\'s resources come under heavy load.</p>  \t\t<p>You\'ll want to make sure that your system is in a good state by updating all major drivers, limiting the amount of programs running during gameplay, as well as updating your operating system to its latest version.</p>  \t\t<p>Detailed steps can be found in the troubleshooting sections below.</p></li>    <h4>Enabling the Steam Overlay</h4>  \t<p>Steam has a global setting that will enable or disable the Steam overlay:</p>  <p>Open the Steam client and navigate to the <span style="font-weight: bold">Steam &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; In-game</span> tab. Check the box next to <span style="font-weight: bold">Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game</span>.</p>  <p><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/support/faq/overlay_options.JPG"></p>  \t  \t  \t<p>Additionally, you can turn on/off the Steam Overlay per game...</p>  \t<ul><li>Find the game in your Library -> Manage menu -> <span style="font-weight: bold">Properties</span>  <li>Under the <span style="font-weight: bold">General</span> tab, you\'ll find a checkbox for <span style="font-weight: bold">Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game</span>  \t\t</ul>    <h5>Steam Overlay Shortcut Keys</h5>    \t<p>The Steam shortcut allows the overlay to be opened in-game. You\'ll want to double check that you have it set correctly.  \t<p>The default shortcut is <span style="font-weight: bold">Shift + Tab</span>. To change the shortcut select <span style="font-weight: bold">Steam &gt; Settings &gt; In-game</span></p>    <h4>Basic Steam Troubleshooting</h4>  <p>The following steps will ensure that Steam is in a good state for the overlay to work. These can be performed with a minimal amount of technical knowledge.</p>    <h5>Restart Computer</h5>  \t<p>It\'s always a good first step to make sure that you restart Steam as well as your computer.</p>  \t<p>Restarting the computer flushes all kinds of system states and caches, while resetting other programs and releasing locks on files and other resources.</p>    <h5>Verify Local Game Files</h5>  \t<p>Sometimes files on hard-disks and other storage devices become corrupted. Some of these files may be associated with the way the game utilizes the overlay. Verifying local files can fix this.</p>  \t<p>Find Game in Library -> Manage menu -> Properties -> Local Files -> Verify Integrity of Game Files</p>    <h5>Reinstall Steam</h5>  \t<p>The Steam installer can be downloaded <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">here</a> and reinstalled to the same location where it is already installed.</p>   \t<p>This will ensure that all files required by the Steam overlay are in a good state. This process will have no effect on your installed games.</p>   \t<p>WARNING! Uninstalling Steam will delete all game content.</p>    <h4>Advanced Troubleshooting</h4>  <p>If the overlay is still working correctly after following the fixes outlined above, it is possible that something outside of Steam is responsible.</p>  <p>Because these are advanced troubleshooting steps, we highly recommend that you contact a local IT support specialist in your area for further assistance with these steps.</p>    <h5>Investigate Firewalls</h5>  \t<p>Certain firewalls may prevent Steam from communicating with the game that requires it. You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that the Firewall is not interfering. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes. It may be necessary to add exceptions in your firewalls for Steam.</p>    <h5>Investigate Anti-Virus Software</h5>  \t<p>AV software hooks very deep into user systems and can affect disk and network operations which will cause issues with Steam. Some games also use copy protection technology that can appear as malicious software to an AV scanner, resulting in potential false-positive alerts.</p>   \t<p>You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that your AV software is not interfering with Steam. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes. It may also be necessary to add exceptions for Steam in your AV configuration (for example, excluding Steam Library folders from live monitoring services).</p>  \t  <h5>Investigate Other Programs Interfering</h5>  \t<p>Any software that modifies or monitors system, disk or network activity can cause issues with the Overlay\'s functionality. These programs and services can run in the background and are typically associated with software like Anti-Virus, ad-blockers, web-optimizers, firewalls, system cleaners, recording software, proxies, performance boosters etc.</p>  \t<p>You\'ll want to work with a specialist to ensure that no outside software is interfering with the Steam Overlay.</p>  \t  <h5>Upgrade Your System</h5>  \t<p>If your system is at or below the required or recommended specifications for the game, the overlay may have difficulty functioning correctly.</p>  \t<p>You\'ll want to work with a specialist in your area to consider upgrading your operating system, or even the hardware that your system uses.</p>',

            '<p>What should I do if Steam is crashing, not opening correctly or closing immediately after launching?</p>  <p>Due to the wide variety of custom hardware and software configurations, Steam crashes may be caused by many factors. The troubleshooting steps outlined in this article are aimed at making sure that your Steam installation and computer environment are both in a good state, so that Steam can work as intended.</p>   <p>There are occasions when crashing issues are not necessarily related to user configurations. These crashes need to be addressed by Steam developers through client updates. We automatically sample and collect crash dumps from affected users, so that fixes can quickly be added through Steam updates.</p>  <p>If you\'re working with Steam Support, they may also ask you to provide more information or perform tests that can narrow down the cause of the issue.</p>  <p>You can always download the latest version of the Steam client application directly from <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">Steam.</a>',
            '<h4>Basic Steam Troubleshooting</h4>  <p>The following steps will ensure that your Steam installation is in a good state. These can be performed with a minimal amount of technical knowledge.</p>    <h5>Restart Computer</h5>  \t<p>As obvious as it sounds, it\'s always a good first step to make sure that you restart Steam as well as your computer.</p>  \t<p>Restarting the computer flushes all kinds of system states and caches, while also resetting other programs and releasing locks on files and other resources.</p>    <h5>Reinstall Steam</h5>  \t<p>The Steam installer can be downloaded here: (<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">http://store.steampowered.com/about/</a>) and reinstalled to the same location where it is already installed.</p>   \t<p>This may fix potential issues with Steam client and service files. Installing into same location will preserve all installed games.</p>   \t<p>WARNING! Uninstalling Steam through any other method will delete all game and userdata content.</p>    <h4>Advanced Troubleshooting</h4>  <p>If the issue is still occurring after following the steps outlined above, it is possible that something outside of Steam is responsible.</p>  <p>Because these advanced troubleshooting steps may be unique to your specific computer configuration, we highly recommend that you contact a local IT support specialist in your area for further assistance completing them.</p>    <h5>Remove External Devices</h5>  \t<p>It is possible that an external device is causing Steam to not work correctly. External input devices require specific drivers that can interfere with Steam. We recommend unplugging all non-essential input devices from your computer to eliminate the possibility that they are interfering.</p>    <h5>Refresh Local Network Hardware</h5>  \t<p>This includes restarting all modems & routers. Network hardware can get into slow/broken state after running for a long time. This can cause the update/login process of launching Steam to fail silently or crash.</p>    <h5>Update OS & Drivers</h5>  \t<p>Make sure your operating system and all hardware drivers are up to date.</p>   \t<p>For Windows: Start → search "update" → run "Check for Updates"</p>  \t<p>For Mac: drivers cannot be updated separately; only the operating system can be updated.</p>\t    <h5>Investigate Anti-Virus Software</h5>  \t<p>AV software hooks very deep into user systems and can affect disk and network operations which will cause issues with Steam. Some games also use copy protection technology that can appear as malicious software to an AV scanner, resulting in potential false-positive alerts.</p>   \t<p>You\'ll want to work with a specialist to ensure that your AV software is not interfering with Steam. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes. It may also be necessary to add exceptions for Steam in your AV configuration.</p>  \t  <h5>Investigate Other Programs & Services</h5>  \t<p>Any software that modifies or monitors system, disk or network activity can cause issues when trying to launch Steam. These programs and services can run in the background and are typically associated with software like Anti-Virus, ad-blockers, web-optimizers, firewalls, system cleaners, recording software, proxies, performance boosters etc.</p>   \t<p>You\'ll want to work with a specialist to ensure that these services & programs are not interfering with Steam. You may even need to temporarily disable them for testing purposes.</p>  \t  <h5>Investigate Firewalls</h5>  \t<p>Certain firewalls may prevent Steam from talking to its servers. You\'ll want to work with a specialist to ensure that the Firewall is not interfering. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes. It may be necessary to add exceptions in your firewalls for Steam if you discover that this is the cause.</p>    <h5>Disable Overclocking</h5>  \t<p>Some users overclock their hardware to gain more performance while running their system outside of manufacturer recommended settings. This can cause memory and file corruption and should be disabled (usually in the computer BIOS).</p>    <h5>Test Online Connection</h5>  \t<p>Some Internet providers cache or compress online data to save bandwidth (especially cellphone networks). This can cause issues with Steam. It is a good idea to test the issue by connecting to an entirely different network, preferably from a different internet service provider (ISP).</p>    <h5>Check Hard Drive for Errors</h5>  \t<p>All storage drives/devices can be affected by file corruption, especially if it is older or running under a heavy load. You\'ll want to work with a specialist to investigate possible issues with your Hard Drive.</p>  \t<p>For Windows: My PC → Right Click on Drive → Properties → Tools → Error checking</p>  \t<p>For Mac OSX: Disk Utility → Click on Drive → Click First Aid (For older OSX versions: click Repair Disk Permissions)</p>    <h5>Check RAM for Errors</h5>  \t<p>Memory errors can cause issues with the Steam installation process, as well as gameplay. You\'ll want to work with a specialist to investigate possible issues with your system memory.</p>  \t<p>Windows : Start -> Find "mdsched" and run Windows memory Diagnostic</p>',

            "<p>How do I download and install custom maps for Source and Gold Source engine games?</p>",
            '<div class="important"> <h3>Important:</h3> <p>Please note that Steam Support does not provide support for custom content. Please use all custom content at your own risk</p> </div> <p>There are a wide variety of community made custom maps available for all VALVe multiplayer games, as well as many community made game Modifications (Mods) that utilize custom maps.</p> <p>Many of these maps are automatically downloaded when you connect to a server running them and you do not already have the custom map installed. However, some servers do not allow map downloading which may require you to download and install your custom maps manually.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Downloading Map Packages from the Internet</h4> <p>Most map authors will package maps as:</p> <ul>     <li>executable installers (files with an .EXE extension)</li>     <li>archives (files with a .ZIP or .RAR extension)</li> </ul> <p><span class="bold">Note</span>: It is important that you only download packaged maps from reputable game resource sites. If the download is not from a site that you trust, do not install it.</p> <p>If you are having difficulty finding sites for custom maps please post for advice on the <a title="SteamPowered User Forums" href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums">SteamPowered User Forums</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Installing Custom Map Packages</h4> <p>Once you have downloaded a custom map or a map pack, you must make sure that the maps are correctly installed before launching the game.</p> <p>These files are usually packaged with the correct file directory structure pre-defined so it should only be necessary to install/extract maps and their associated resources to the correct directory if you are extracting the files individually or you are not using a program such as WinZip, WinRar or 7-zip.</p> <p>Be sure to double check that map resources are installed in the correct directories, as this is the most common reason for custom maps failing to load in-game.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5><span class="bold">Custom Map ReadMe files</span></h5> <p>Most custom map packages include a ReadMe.txt file. It is always a good idea to read this file before installing a custom map, as many maps might have special installation instructions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5><span class="bold">Installing Maps for Source Engine Games</span></h5> <p>To install custom maps for Source engine games (e.g. Day of Defeat: Source, Counter-Strike: Source, Team Fortress 2) you should extract the custom map in to the application directory. For example, the default location is:</p> <p><tt>C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\&lt; Steam account name &gt;\\day of defeat source\\dod</tt></p> <p>This should extract content to the correct folders as per the following example:</p> <ul>     <li>.BSP Files: <br />     <tt>C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\&lt; Steam account name &gt;\\day of defeat source\\dod\\maps</tt></li>     <li>Sound Files: <br />     <tt>C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\&lt; Steam account name &gt;\\day of defeat source\\dod\\sound</tt></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5><span class="bold">Installing Maps for Gold Source Games</span></h5> <p>To install custom maps for Gold Source engine games (e.g. Day of Defeat, Counter-Strike 1.6, Team Fortress Classic) you should extract the custom map in the application directory. For example:</p> <p><tt>C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\&lt; Steam account name &gt;\\counter-strike\\cstrike</tt></p> <p>This should extract content to the correct folders as per the following example:</p> <ul>     <li>.WAD Files: <br />     <tt>C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\&lt; Steam account name &gt;\\counter-strike\\cstrike</tt></li>     <li>.BSP Files: <br />     <tt>C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\&lt; Steam account name &gt;\\counter-strike\\cstrike\\maps</tt></li>     <li>Sound Files: <br />     <tt>C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\&lt; Steam account name &gt;\\counter-strike\\cstrike\\sound</tt></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p>',

Acceleration is a feature that lets you move across the screen quickly but not lose control. Without acceleration, you might have to pick the mouse up and re-position it on the pad before you can get to the other side of the screen.</li>          <li>Buttons - all the different functions you can set you buttons to do - most of which are not suitable for playing Half-life.</li>      </ul>      </li>      <li>      <h5>Mouse Manufacturer (Custom Drivers and Driver Extensions)</h5>      <p>Mouse manufacturers create drivers that let the mouse do a lot more then just point and click, they want the mouse to be a highly integrated control device and a unique part of the program you are running.</p>      <p>Unfortunately, many of these programmatic extensions (and the drivers themselves) just add wierd delays and unnecessary processing when you are in the game.</p>      <p>Half-Life has it\'s own set of drivers for the mouse and keyboard which talk directly to the Mouse API within the Operating System ... unless the mouse drivers and extensions are hijacking the mouse first. It is there that weird things can happen.</p>      <p>Ideally, the very best setup is the O/S and mouse drivers get the heck out of the way and let HL totally control the mouse and keyboard.</p>      <p>Unfortunately, HL can\'t possibly understand all the hundreds (or thousands) of mouse designs so the unique drivers for the mouse hardware have to have an interpretive layer above it (again the API).</p>      </li>      <li>      <h5>USB HUBs, Batteries and Power Saving Features</h5>      <p>One additional thing to remember is that motherboards and the operating system have several levels of power savings available. Especially on notebook computers, you may find that your USB power might be getting disabled to save power while you are playing!</p>      <p>Wireless Keyboards and Mice have batteries which can run out or get low so they can start acting odd too.</p>      </li>  </ol>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h4>Console Commands for Mouse Configuration</h4>  <p>Here are the three commandline (launch option) switches you can add to change how HL manages your mouse behavior and properties:</p>  <ul>      <li>      <p><tt>-noforcemparms</tt> (use desktop mouse buttons settings)</p>      <p>This setting tells HL to use whatever button assignments you have set in the mouse properties. You have to make sure each button has a letter or function-key assignment appropriate for the game.</p>      <p>Normally HL forces it\'s own set of button definitions onto the mouse and when you return to the O/S all the buttons return to your operating system setup. This switch turns that off.</p>      </li>      <li>      <p><tt>-noforcemaccel</tt> (use desktop mouse acceleration settings)</p>      <p>Normally in HL the last thing you want is acceleration. Sometimes the HL no-acceleration control won\'t work because the mouse or its drivers are too different.</p>      <p>This switch tells HL to bugger off trying to manage the acceleration and whatever you have set in the mouse properties for the desktop is what will happen in the game.</p>      </li>      <li>      <p><tt>-noforcemspd</tt> (use desktop mouse speed settings)</p>      <p>This tells HL to use the speed settings you have set on your desktop. Whatever you set in your mouse properties is how it will behave in HL.</p>      <p>This is separate from the &quot;sensitivity&quot; setting in your mouse properties, think of the sensitivity as an amplifier, it can attenuate the movement, leave it exactly the same or amplify it.</p>      </li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>',

            "<p>Steam encourages players to customize their community profiles with an avatar image and profile name. Avatars and profile names are an important part of a player's public identity and serve dual purposes of self-expression and public identification. Your avatar and name will be visible to both friends and strangers in many places. These places include multiplayer games, chatting with friends in chat rooms, on leaderboards, in discussion forums, and attached to reviews or published content.</p>    <p>Since avatars and names are public, it is important that they are appropriate for all members of Steam's all-ages international community. We recognize the value of your self-expression, and we also recognize that judging the appropriateness of avatars and names is difficult and depends on cultural and group context. We ask that you seek to balance self-expression with a reasonable evaluation of whether your content is appropriate for our very broad and diverse community.</p>    <p>If your avatar or name is moderated or is cleared by our support and moderation staff, please understand that our goal is simply to keep these public pieces from offending or harming other members of the community. Please seek to avoid such content as disturbing images, sexual content, harassment, or any kind of harmful or illegal activity, and make sure your profile name follows our <a href=\"https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810\">Communtiy Guidelines</a>.</p>",

Also keep in mind that because these are publicly avaialble once uploaded, other sites may scrape this content and keep a permanent record of it.</p>     <h3><a name=historyname></a>How do I remove my profile name history?</h3>  <p>Steam stores the previous 10 names that you\'ve used for your profile.

We do store avatar images on our content servers to serve any player that may be using that image. We do not give players a way to purge images from our content servers. Keep this in mind when uploading content to Steam.</p>     <p>If a third-party site is showing an old image associated to your account, we encourage you to ask them to remove this association.</p>     <h3><a name=trouble></a>I\'m having trouble editing my profile?</h3>  <p>If you are trying to edit your profile within the Steam client, you\'ll want to make sure you are logged in to the Steam need to ensure that you are not in offline mode and that you are logged in to Friends & Chat (lower right corner of the client).</p>     <p> If you are still not able to edit this content, please try again from your preferred web browser at https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/info</p>     <h3><a name=banned></a>What if my content has been banned?</h3>  <p>If you\'ve recently had an avatar or profile name removed by support, you\'ll be prevented from changing them for a period of time indicated from your profile page. The length of time is based on whether or not you\'ve had content removed in the past. Players who repeatedly have content removed, risk temporarily losing the ability to use the Steam Community.</p>     <h3><a name=appeal></a>What if content was removed by mistake?</h3>  <p>We understand that subjectivity is necessary when applying any of these guidelines.

If they are, you might have to wait for the download to finish before playing.</p>  <p>Also, make sure that you have any Peer-2-Peer programs and File Sharing disabled since they can cause these symptoms as well.</p>  <p>It's also a good idea to check how much memory you have free on your system before you start playing a game. You can see this by looking in your Task Manager, accessable from the tool bar (right-click) or by entering &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;del&gt; once.</p>  <p>Then look in the Performance Window for specific information, specifically the Physical Memory and &quot;PF&quot; or Page File usage.</p>  <p>You will need at least 200MB Free Memory before you play Half-Life or you could have problems.</p>  <p>If you only have 256MB of memory to start, you need to be sure you exit from everything like Internet Explore, AIM, MSN and anything else that will use memory and cause problems.</p>  <p>One thing you can to to help is to disable any unnecessary services that are running on your computer.

Please see <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1456-EUDN-2493">Troubleshooting Network Connectivity</a>, step 1: &quot;Test Your Router&quot; to determine if this is your issue.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h4>CyberCafe</h4>  <p>If you are in a CyberCafe and there are a lot of players refreshing their browsers,&nbsp;this may cause problems in the CyberCafe network.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing the Steam rate for all the workstations will help this problem.</p>',

            "<h4>Creating a custom single-color decal</h4> <p>Making a custom decal is a simple process. All you need is an image, and a paint program capable of simple palette manipulation.</p> <ol>     <li>     <h5>Paint or scan an image</h5>     <p>Make it 64 by 64 pixels in size, either by painting the image to that size, or by scaling your scanned image (or larger painted image).</p>     <p>Using black and white colors are recommended, because the final decal will be displayed as one color only.</p>     <p>You can choose the color of your decal and you can change that color at any time between games using the game interface.</p>     <p>Save your source decal as a black and white image.</p>     </li>     <li>     <h5>Make the image a &quot;grayscale&quot; image</h5>     <p>If you are painting the image yourself using Paint Shop Pro, Photoshop, or some similar program, you can specify that you want the image to be grayscale before you start.</p>     <p>With the palette going from black to white, any white in the image will be totally opaque, and any black in the image will be totally transparent (invisible). Any gray in the image will be translucent: very translucent if it is near-black, and close to opaque if it is near white.</p>     <p>Some applications will ramp the palette from black to white when you select &quot;grayscale.&quot; That is, if you look at the color palette, the first color (usually the upper left-hand corner color) will be black, and the last color (usually the lower right-hand corner color) will be white.</p>     <p>In this case, you want to invert your image, such that the black portions of your image are the parts that will be opaque, and the white portions are the parts that will be transparent.</p>     <p>Be sure you check what the palette looks like after you save your file, and adjust it if necessary. Think of it this way: if your decal looks like a chalk drawing on a blackboard, you want the first color in your palette to be black (which will come through as completely transparent), ramping to the last color which is white (which will come through as opaque). If your drawing looks like a pen drawing on white paper, the first color should be white, ramping to the last color which should be black.</p>     </li>     <li>     <h5>Save image to /logos/ directory as a Windows bitmap (.bmp) file</h5>     <p>Once the image has been saved to the /logos/ directory (found under C:\\Programs\\Steam\\SteamApps\\&lt;your username&gt;\\&lt;game title&gt;\\ by default) it will automatically show up in the list of decals you see in the launcher interface. There you can choose the decal's color.</p>     <p>Note: Changing the color of your decal during a game will not take effect for that game. Only after you restart your game will the new color appear.</p>     <p>If you would like to view pre-made decals, several are shipped with Half-Life and can be found in the Half-Life\\logos directory. These will give you a good idea about the file format and appearance of a decal before it appears in the game.</p>     </li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "<p><a name=\"overview\"></a></p> <h4>Overview</h4> <p>Half-Life TV offers the ability to have an unlimited number of spectators watching online games. They can follow the game just like they would as a spectator on the game server. Spectators are invisible to players and can't interact with the running game in any way. Each spectator can choose any view position or choose any player to track individually.</p> <p>To have the most enjoyable spectating experience, spectators can enable the Auto-Director mode. Then the camera is changed automatically so that only interesting scenes are shown from a suitable viewpoint. Thus the spectator can lean back and won't miss any relevant action. All the time, spectators may communicate between each other using the standard HL chat system.</p> <p>Most popular Half-Life MODs are supported like Counter-Strike, Team Fortress Classic, Day of Defeat and many others. HLTV providers have full control over their HLTV system, may change number of spectator slots, add text messages or change the HLTV logo.</p> <p>The broadcast is delayed by a customizable amount of time, by default 30 seconds. This ensures that the playing teams can't use HLTV to get any usable information about their opponents. Providing a single HLTV server for up to 100 spectators is an easy task and doesn't need any changes in default configurations.</p> <p>Installing a larger HLTV network for thousands of spectators needs some more planning time and experience about required bandwidth and CPU/RAM demands <a href=\"#large\">(see Larger Broadcasts)</a>.</p> <p><a name=\"spectate\"></a></p> <h4>Spectate</h4> <p>To watch a HLTV game, start Half-Life, open the Multiplayer menu and select 'Find Servers'. To search for currently broadcasted games, choose the 'Spectate' section and hit 'Refresh All'. After the list has been updated, double click on the server you want to spectate and you'll be connected.</p> <p>If computer game leagues announce important matches to be broadcasted via HLTV, they often provide IP:Port addresses of their HLTV servers. Instead of searching them via the server browser, you can also go to the 'Favorites' folder and add the HLTV address to your server list by pressing the right mouse button. Otherwise, you can also open the console window and use the 'connect' command to spectate a certain game.</p> <p>For example:</p> <p>connect 192.168.130.42:27020</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The default HLTV port number is 27020, but may be changed. It should always be included in the given address, since commonly this port number is different from the default port number 27015.</p> <p>You can spectate the game in different modes: Chase Cam, First Person, Free Look, Map Overview and Map Chase. The easiest way to change modes is to press the JUMP key (default SPACE). Alternatively you can use the spectator menu, which can be enabled by pressing the DUCK key (default CTRL). Here you can customize your personal view style and enable the Auto-Director Mode. Press USE (default E) to cycle through the different Picture-In-Picture modes.</p> <p>The following HL console commands can be used to customize spectator settings:</p> <ul>     <li><tt>spec_autodirector &lt;0|1&gt; </tt>- turns Auto Director mode on or off</li>     <li><tt>spec_drawcone &lt;0|1&gt; </tt>- shows your view cone in map overview mode</li>     <li><tt>spec_drawnames &lt;0|1&gt; </tt>- shows player names under their icons</li>     <li><tt>spec_drawstatus &lt;0|1&gt; </tt>- shows game information (time, map etc)</li>     <li><tt>spec_pip &lt;0|1&gt; </tt>- turns Picture-In-Picture mode on or off</li>     <li><tt>spec_menu </tt>- opens the spectator menu</li>     <li><tt>spec_help </tt>- shows a help screen</li>     <li><tt>spec_mode &lt;1-6&gt; [&lt;0-4&gt;] </tt>- set the main view mode, seconds parameter is the PIP mode. Not all combinations are valid.</li> </ul> <p>Main modes are:</p> <ul>     <li><b>1</b> : Locked Chase</li>     <li><b>2 </b>: Free Chase</li>     <li><b>3</b> : Free Roaming</li>     <li><b>4</b> : First Person</li>     <li><b>5</b> : Map Overview</li>     <li><b>6</b> : Chase Map Overview</li> </ul> <p>PIP modes are:</p> <ul>     <li><b>0</b> : PIP off</li>     <li><b>1</b> : Free Chase</li>     <li><b>2</b> : First Person</li>     <li><b>3</b> : Map Overview</li>     <li><b>4</b> : Chase Map Overview</li> </ul> <p><a name=\"basics\"></a></p> <h4>Basics</h4> <p>The core of the HLTV broadcasting system is the HLTV server, also called HLTV proxy. The HLTV executable is a console application that works much like a HL dedicated server. To broadcast a game running on a certain game server, the HLTV proxy connects to this server just like a normal player.</p> <p>Spectators connect themselves to the HLTV proxy and the game data stream is relayed through the HLTV proxy to all connected spectator clients. The next figure shows a basic HLTV configuration:</p> <p>HL Game Server -&gt; HLTV Proxy =&gt; Spectator Clients</p> <p>The number of clients that one HLTV proxy can serve depends on available hardware and network resources. Theoretically, a single proxy can hold a maximum of 255 spectator clients. But be careful, even a proxy with 100 spectator clients needs a full 2 MBit line to run smoothly. If more spectator slots are needed, the required network load must be distributed over multiple HLTV proxies.</p> <p>The first HLTV proxy connected to the game server is called the Master proxy, which sets the general broadcast settings like game stream delay or packet rate. All other HLTV proxies linked to this proxy are the Relay proxies. Their total number and link order is not restricted, they may form a chain or tree of proxies. Most important is that their location is in different networks to ensure a balanced bandwidth usage.</p> <p>-&gt; HLTV Relay Proxy 1 =&gt; Spectator Clients</p> <p>HL Game Server -&gt; HLTV Master -&gt; HLTV Relay Proxy 2 =&gt; Spectator Clients</p> <p>-&gt; HLTV Relay Proxy 3 =&gt; Spectator Clients</p> <p><a name=\"broadcast\"></a></p> <h4>Broadcast</h4> <p>Let's assume the most simple configuration, a single HLTV proxy in a LAN environment. This is a very common situation and the default HLTV settings doesn't need to be changed. Choose a dedicated computer as your HLTV proxy and install the Half-Life Dedicated Server, which also includes all files needed by a HLTV proxy. This isn't needed if Half-Life is already installed.</p> <p>Start the HLTV application (HL icon with a small camera) and the HLTV console will open, showing some initialization messages (if that takes a long time, HLTV maybe can't resolve some IP addresses, then start HLTV with the '-nodns' command line option). Then the console is ready to accept your commands, here we use '&gt;' as the console prompt. First give your HLTV proxy an unique name:</p> <p>&gt; <tt>name &quot;My HLTV Proxy&quot; </tt></p> <p>Let's assume you have started the proxy on host <b>192.168.1.2</b> and the game server, you want to spectate is running on host <b>192.168.1.3:27015</b>. Then connect the HLTV proxy to this game server by typing:</p> <p>&gt; <tt>connect 192.168.1.3:27015 </tt></p> <p>After a few seconds HLTV will be fully connected and ready to serve spectator clients. Use the ' <b>status</b> ' command to verify that the HLTV proxy has connected properly :</p> <p>&gt; <tt>status </tt><br /> --- HLTV Status ---<br /> Online 00:23, FPS 79.0, Version 2435 (Win32)<br /> Local IP 192.168.1.2:27020, Network In 1.7, Out 1.0, Loss 0.00<br /> Local Slots 128, Spectators 0, Proxies 0<br /> Total Slots 128, Spectators 0, Proxies 1<br /> Source Game Server 192.168.1.3:27015, Delay 30<br /> Server Name &quot;Half-Life dedicated server&quot;<br /> Time 01:35, Game &quot;valve&quot;, Map &quot;maps/rapidcore.bsp&quot;, Players 1</p> <p>The <b>'status'</b> command shows your own IP address, HLTV system cycles per second, total incoming and outgoing network traffic in kB/sec. Local slot and spectator numbers your HLTV proxy is providing, total numbers are the sum of all slots &amp; spectators on all proxies broadcasting this game. The game source can be a game server, another HLTV proxy or a demo file.</p> <p><a name=\"record\"></a></p> <h4>Record</h4> <p>HLTV demo files are like normal recorded games in Half-Life, but you can choose any view point, view mode or player to chase during replay. To play back a HLTV demo, a HLTV proxy is not needed. Just start Half-Life and type in console <tt>playdemo &lt;demoname&gt; </tt>or <tt>viewdemo &lt;demoname&gt; </tt>(viewdemo offers more options during playback like fast forward/backward, pause &amp; slowmotion). To record a HLTV demo, connect the proxy to a game server (see <a href=\"#broadcast\">Broadcasting Games</a> ) and type in console:</p> <p><tt>record &lt;name&gt; </tt></p> <p>All games will be recorded after issuing this command. The demo files will be saved in the current Mod directory, e.g. <b>\\cstrike</b>. All demo files have a special naming convention <b>&lt;name&gt;-&lt;YYMMDDhhmm&gt;-&lt;map&gt;.dem,</b> including the given name, date/time and map name. Demo files record the same data as send to spectator clients. That means also, the demo file records the game with the same delay as used for spectators. To verify, that a demo file is recorded use the <tt>status </tt>command. The recording may be stopped with <tt>stoprecording </tt>.</p> <p>Sometimes a HLTV broadcast is not wanted and the HLTV proxy is only used to record a demo file. In this case, some HLTV settings should be made to gain optimal recording results:</p> <p><tt>maxclients 0 </tt>// don't allow any spectator clients<br /> <tt>delay 0 </tt>// no game stream delay<br /> <tt>rate 10000 </tt>// maximum data rate<br /> <tt>updaterate 20 </tt>// standard update rate<br /> <tt>nomaster 1 </tt>// don't register at master servers</p> <p><a name=\"large\"></a></p> <h4>Large</h4> <p>Setting up a HLTV network that can handle a larger number of spectators (&gt;1000) is a difficult and time consuming task. The following guide should help to configure and run such a HLTV network. One of the most important rule should be <b>Quality, not Quantity</b>. It's better to offer a smaller number of spectator slots, than operating at the maximum bandwidth limit, thus all spectators would suffer from lags and timeouts. Check carefully your available bandwidth capacity and calculate how many spectators can be handled by your HLTV servers. The average bandwidth demand per spectator is between 2 and 3 KB/sec and depends on the current mod, map and number of players. CPU and RAM shouldn't be a bottleneck on modern PC systems.</p> <p>This list for common Internet connection types gives a feeling, how bandwidth-demanding HLTV can be:</p> <ul>     <li><b>ISDN 64 Kbps</b> : 2 spectators</li>     <li><b>DSL 128 Kbps</b> (upstream) : 5 spectators</li>     <li><b>T1 1.5 Mbps</b> : 75 spectators</li>     <li><b>LAN 10 Mbps</b> : 500 spectators</li>     <li><b>T3 75 Mbps</b> : 4000 spectators</li> </ul> <p>Use the <tt>maxclients </tt>command to set how many clients should be accepted by a HLTV proxy. Make sure that the <tt>maxrate </tt>variable is set too a reasonable value, e.g. 3500 kB/sec. Lower values are possible, but make sure spectators don't get too much <a href=\"/kb_article.php?ref=7093-URMF-5263\">choke</a> during a running game.</p> <p>The <b>maxrate</b> command doesn't effect the bandwidth limit between HLTV proxies, only for spectator clients. To lower the general bandwidth demand, you can turn off the internal HLTV chat ( <tt>chatmode 0 </tt>) or decrease the game update rate from the default value 20 to 10 ( <tt>updaterate 10 </tt>). A lower update rate may save up to 25% network traffic and is an acceptable tradeoff in this case since spectators doesn't need a high update rate like real players does.</p> <p>A very common setup for large broadcasts is to use 2 dedicated HLTV servers to create a private and a public HLTV segment. Let's assume the game server is in a closed LAN and not accessible from outside. This ensures a maximum security against attacks (DOS etc) from outside. The HLTV master server is started within the LAN and it's IP address should be kept secret. The second HLTV server is started outside the LAN with a global IP and is connected to the HLTV master server. This second HLTV server is the public HLTV dispatcher, which IP address is given to the audience. Any relay proxies are connected to this HLTV dispatcher. Thus the HLTV master server is in a secure LAN environment and can be used for demo recording or for HL clients serving video projectors. Spectators connect to the HLTV dispatcher and are relayed through the HLTV network to a relay proxy with a low usage. Thus the total network load is balanced between all connected HLTV proxies.</p> <p><b>+---- Private LAN -----+ +------ Public Internet --------+<br /> -&gt; HLTV Proxy 1<br /> <br /> HL Server -&gt; HLTV Master -&gt; HLTV Dispatcher -&gt; HLTV Proxy 2 -&gt; HLTV Proxy 3</b></p> <p>The configuration files of HLTV master and HLTV dispatcher are different:</p> <h5>master.cfg:</h5> <p><tt>nomaster 1 </tt>// don't register at WON/STEAM master servers<br /> <tt>proxypassword MyPWD </tt>// protect HLTV server<br /> <tt>publicgame 0 </tt>// don't show game server IP<br /> <tt>dispatchmode 0 </tt>// don't dispatch spectators</p> <h5>dispatcher.cfg:</h5> <p><tt>forcemaster 1 </tt>// register at WON/STEAM master servers<br /> <tt>publicgame 0 </tt>// don't show game server IP<br /> <tt>dispatchmode 2 </tt>// dispatch all clients to other proxies<br /> <tt>hostname MyGame </tt>// public HLTV server name</p> <p>If you're running 3 or more HLTV servers in total, it's a good idea to use RCON to manage them via a single server admin tool. To enable RCON on a HLTV server an <b>adminpassword</b> must been set. Also <b>proxypassword</b> should be set to ensure only known HLTV providers can connect to your HLTV network.

For the Client Dedicated Server, the folder for cstrike is typically located here:</p>  <p><b>C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\</b><b>[account name]</b><b>\\dedicated server\\cstrike</b></p>  <p>Copy over the following folders:</p>  <ul>      <li>maps</li>      <li>sound</li>      <li>sprites</li>      <li>gfx</li>      <li>overviews</li>      <li>models</li>  </ul>  <p>If there are any custom WAD files (*.wad) in the cstrike folder. copy those over to the server cstrike folder as well.</p>  <p>You can install downloaded maps to both your client and to the dedicated server.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>',

            "<p>Why&nbsp;isn&#39;t downtime&nbsp;scheduled in the mornings?</p>    <p>Why was downtime scheduled? I patiently waited, but didn&#39;t see any new features!</p>  ",
            '<h4>Why&nbsp;isn&#39;t downtime&nbsp;scheduled in the mornings? Seems kind of silly to schedule downtime right in the middle of the peak usage period (e.g. 9pm).</h4>    <p>There are several different reasons. First, some downtime isn&#39;t planned. If we have a hardware failure, a problem with the network, or a problem with our point-of-presence provider, the event is unexpected and we can&#39;t schedule it. It happens when it happens.</p>    <p>When downtime is scheduled, we try to perform the activity during business hours at our office in the Pacific time zone (in the United States). This way, as many team members as possible are available to help with issues that might arise and get the work done. We try to stagger the events at different times of day.</p>    <p>It&#39;s important to remember that Steam is a global service, so there are always <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/stats/" title="Steam &amp; Game Stats">users online</a>. Our peak user load is around noon at our local time, and our lowest user count is around 2300 local time.</p>    <p>When we have planned downtime, it usually lasts less than an hour. As such, we&#39;ll do it in the early morning or in the late afternoon (again, local time) trying to avoid the peak time of the day. If we have plans for extended downtime, we&#39;ll do what we can to schedule the time as late as possible in the evening--with the caveat that we still need staff available to do the work or to help with any problems that might occur.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h4>Why was downtime scheduled? I patiently waited, but didn&#39;t see any new features!</h4>    <p>Sometimes, we take the servers down in order to perform maintenance. We might be patching software for security issues, updating operating systems or drivers, or installing new hardware, for example. These activities don&#39;t result in new features, but allow Steam to continue to run stably and efficiently.</p>    <p>Other down time events are used to publish new features in the server code. Sometimes, those features might not be immediately visible; making the servers use less memory, for example, allows them to support more users and have faster response times. Keeping the system up and running efficiently is our top priority. As time allows, we add features and publish them when they&#39;re available.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>  \x3c!--   <h4>Where else can I find information on downtime?</h4>  <p>In addition to the <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=784745&amp;goto=newpost">Steam Forums</a>, we also post downtime on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Steam">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam_Support">Twitter</a>:</p>  <p style="margin-left: 37px; margin-top: 5px;"><a class="twitter-timeline" href="https://twitter.com/Steam_Support" data-widget-id="253582956885581824">Tweets by @Steam_Support</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  --\x3e',

            '<h3>Common causes:</h3>  <ul>      <li>      <h5>The Host (the game server you are connecting to)</h5>      <p>The host of the game is using file sharing applications or otherwise downloading content on the same internet connection as they are using to host a game. This results in poor performance, even though their connection appears to be very good.</p>      </li>      <li>      <h5>The Client (your connection)</h5>      <p>The client connection to the game is downloading files from the internet on the same internet connection as they are using to connect to a game. This is almost the same scenario, but the issue is originating with the client connecting to the server. Please ensure that you are not running anything like BitTorrent or other download managers from an active PC while attempting to connect to a TF2 or L4D&nbsp;server on your Xbox 360.</p>      </li>  </ul>  <p>The most common reason for losing connection to the host is that the host closed the server or disconnected. There is no way around this in TF2.&nbsp; In L4D, you can try connecting to an available Dedicated Server which will allow all players to continue through the match even if the Lobby host were to leave.</p>  <p>If performance issues persist, you may need to contact <a href="http://support.xbox.com">XBox Live Support</a>&nbsp;to troubleshoot further.</p>',

            '<h3>Why are these features not available?</h3>  <p>Malicious users often operate using dummy accounts that have not purchased any games, items, or wallet credit. In order to make it more difficult for these malicious users to spam, scam, and phish other users, we restrict access to certain community features until an account has spent at least $5.00 USD in Steam.</p>    <h3>How do I gain access to these features?</h3>  <p>You will need to spend at least <b>$5.00 USD</b> within the Steam store. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view your current limited user spend.</p>    <p>Some examples of purchases that grant access to these features are:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Adding the equivalent of $5 USD or more to your <a alt="Steam Wlalet" href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1122-RTSC-0478">Steam Wallet</a></li>  \t<li>Purchasing game(s) that are equal to $5 USD or more from the <a alt="Steam Store" href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam store</a></li>  \t<li>Adding a <a alt="Wallet card" href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/redeemwalletcode">Steam Wallet card</a> that is equal to $5 USD or more to your Steam account</li>  \t<li>Purchasing a<a alt="Steam gift" href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6262-QXCN-0755"> Steam gift</a> that is equal to $5 USD or more from the Steam store (Receiving a Steam gift or digital gift card from a friend <b>doesn\'t</b> count)</li>  </ul>    <p>The below actions <b>will not</b> remove limited user restrictions:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Activating a retail game on Steam</li>  \t<li>Playing free demos</li>  \t<li>Adding a non-Steam game as a shortcut</li>  \t<li>Spending funds from items you have sold on the market</li>  \t<li>Adding/playing promotional trials like Free Weekends</li>  \t<li>Free to Play games (Examples: Alien Swarm, free versions of Portal and Team Fortress 2)</li>  \t<li>Activating promotional CD Keys from hardware or graphic card manufacturers</li>  </ul>    <p>Each Steam purchase total will be tracked in USD. If your Steam store\'s currency isn\'t in USD, it will be tracked and converted to USD automatically using daily exchange rates.</p>    <h3>What features are unavailable?</h3>    <p>Limited user accounts are prevented from accessing several features on Steam, including but not limited to:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Sending friend and group invites</li>      <li>Requesting access to groups</li>  \t<li>Opening group chat</li>  \t<li>Voting on Steam Reviews and Workshop items</li>  \t<li>Participating in the Steam Market</li>      <li>Trading Steam Community items (trading cards, booster packs, gems, etc.)</li>      <li>Making your Steam profile visible to non-friends</li>  \t<li>Posting frequently in the Steam Discussions</li>  \t<li>Gaining Steam Profile Levels (Locked to level 0) and Trading Cards</li>  \t<li>Submitting content on the Steam Workshop</li>  \t<li>Posting in an item\'s Steam Workshop Discussions</li>  \t<li>Creating public Steam guides</li>  \t<li>Accessing the Steam Web API</li>  \t<li>Using browser and mobile chat</li>  \t<li>Adding public artwork and screenshots</li>  \t<li>Adding messages to trade offers</li>  \t<li>Creating Steam groups</li>  \t<li>Counting towards Steam group membership</li>          <li>Following/adding curators</li>          <li>Posting hyperlinks in the Steam Community</li>  </ul>    <h4>Frequently asked questions</h4>  <h5>I received my game(s) as a gift, will I gain access to all features?</h5>  <p>No, games that have been received as a gift or via Steam Trading are not eligible.</p>    <h5>What if a purchase is refunded to my bank or my purchase is disputed/chargeback?</h5>  <p>If a purchase amount is returned to your bank, the amount will be subtracted from your account\'s total purchase value. If the refund or dispute amount brings your account\'s total purchase value below $5 USD, then your account will lose access to these features.</p>  <p>For example, if you purchase a game for $5 USD, your account will gain access to these Community features. If you open a dispute with your bank, these funds will be returned to the bank and you will lose access to these features because Steam never received the funds.</p>    <h5>What if a purchase is refunded to my Steam Wallet?</h5>  <p>Refunds credited to your Steam Wallet, such as pre-order refunds, do not modify access to these Steam Community features.</p>    <h5>What if my account wasn\'t limited and now it is?</h5>  <p>Your account\'s total spend was most recently calculated as less than $5.00 USD, and your account has become limited as a result. This could be a result of a calculation mistake which commonly affected accounts with more than $1.00 USD but less than $5.00 USD of total spend.</p>    <h5>What if my Steam store currency isn\'t in USD?</h5>  <p>If the Steam store isn\'t in USD, we will track the purchase amount in USD by converting each purchase total made on Steam using daily exchange rates. Once you have made the equivalent of $5.00 USD or more in total Steam purchases, you will gain access to the restricted Steam features.</p>    <h5>How can I add a friend with a limited account?</h5>  <p>Limited accounts are restricted from adding friends. However, you can still accept friend invites from other non-limited users. For example, if a friend is already on Steam and has spent $5 USD or more from the Steam store, they will be able to add you as a friend from your Steam Community profile. You may then accept their friend invite from your Steam account.</p>    <h5>Can I post in the discussions with a limited account?</h5>  <p>You can, however there are several limitations that will impact your ability to freely post. First, your account must have 60 minutes of playtime (free games count). Second, you must own the game in question if you are posting in a game\'s community hub. Finally, posting with a limited account is rate limited to only allow a small amount of posts per day.</p>    <h5>What if my purchase is pending or processing? When will I become unlimited?</h5>  <p>A purchase amount only counts towards this limit if it was processed successfully. If a purchase is pending/processing or our system is waiting to confirm payment with your bank it will not count towards this limit.</p>    <h5>What exchange rates are used when calculating the USD value of my purchases?</h5>  <p>We use the daily exchange rate at the time of purchase to calculate your account\'s USD spend on Steam. If you made a purchase in the past, we used that day\'s exchange rate, not today\'s rate.</p>',

The first level of security on your account is your login credentials: your Steam account name and password. With Steam Guard, a second level of security is applied to your account, making it harder for your Steam account to fall into the wrong hands.</p>    <p>When Steam Guard is enabled on your account, when you login to your Steam account from an unrecognized device you\'ll need to provide a special access code to verify it\'s your account. Depending on your Steam Guard settings, you\'ll either receive an email with the special code or you\'ll get it from the Steam Mobile app on your smartphone.</p>    <p><a name="enableemail"></a></p>    <h4>How do I enable Steam Guard via email?</h4>    <p>Steam Guard is enabled by default on your Steam account if your email is verified and you have restarted Steam twice since verifying your email. If you have disabled Steam Guard, and wish to reactivate it, please follow the instructions below:</p>    <ol>  \t<li><span class="bold">Be sure your contact email address is verified with Steam.</span><br />  \tYou must verify your contact email address with Steam. You can check whether your email address is already verified by visiting Steam Account Settings. A verified address will be marked as &quot;Verified.&quot; <a href="kb_article.php?ref=5151-RUAS-1543#verify" title="How do I verify my email address?">Learn how to verify your email address</a>.</li>  \t<li><b>Enable Steam&nbsp;Guard in Steam Settings.&nbsp;</b><br />  \tWhile logged into the Steam client, you can enable Steam Guard by clicking on&nbsp;&quot;Steam&quot; in the top left hand corner of the client. Then&nbsp; go to &quot;Settings&quot; and click&nbsp;&quot;Manage Steam Guard Account Security&quot; under the Account tab.</li>  </ol>    <p>That\'s it! With Steam Guard enabled, you will be asked to enter the special access code sent to your email address each time you login to Steam from an unrecognized device.</p>    <p><a name="enablephone"></a></p>    <h4>How do I enable Steam Guard via my smartphone?</h4>    <p>Getting Steam Guard codes via your smartphone provides the best level of Steam account security because you\'re authorizing your logins with a physical device that you possess. You\'ll need to <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/mobile">download and install the free Steam Mobile app to your phone</a>.</p>    <p><a name="limit"></a></p>    <h4>Is there a limit to the number of machines that can be authorized?</h4>    <p>No, there\'s no limit. Steam Guard is aimed to protect the value that is yours, not limit your access to your stuff. As always, you can access your Steam account and library from as many machines as you\'d like.</p>    <p><a name="deauthorize"></a></p>    <h4>How do I deauthorize a device?</h4>    <p>Deauthorizing a machine means it will look like a new device next time you use it to log in and a Steam Guard code will be required.</p>    <p>If you\'ve mistakenly checked the &quot;remember me&quot; box when logging in to a public computer or if your account has been compromised, you should deauthorize any computers that you\'ve previously Steam Guarded. You can do this from your Account Details page &gt; Manage Steam Guard and select &quot;Deauthorize all other devices&quot; at the bottom of the page. This will deauthorize all computers or devices other than the one you\'re performing this action from.</p>    <p><a name="code"></a></p>    <h4>How do I get a new Steam Guard code?</h4>    <p>Via email - Exit Steam and log back into your account. This will generate a new verification email.</p>    <p>Via phone - The Mobile Authenticator will automatically generate a new code every 30 seconds.</p>    <p>Always ensure that you enter the most recent code sent or generated - older codes will not work!</p>    <p><a name="email"></a></p>    <h4>I\'m not receiving a Steam Guard email&hellip;</h4>    <p>Make sure that you are watching the inbox for the email address associated with your Steam account. Perhaps you used a different email address?</p>    <p>If you are not receiving the e-mail at all, check your spam filters and spam inbox.</p>    <p>Please try adding &quot;support@steampowered.com&quot; and &quot;noreply@steampowered.com&quot; to your contacts or trusted senders list within your email client and <a href="#code">request a new access code.</a></p>    <p>Even though Steam instantly sends an email, you may encounter a delay with some email providers depending on their server load and processing times. Please <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php" title="Steam Support">contact us</a> if you have not received&nbsp;the&nbsp;verification&nbsp;email after 3 hours.</p>    <p><a name="auth"></a></p>    <h4>Why am I being asked to authenticate a &quot;new device&quot; every time I log in on the same device?</h4>    <p>This may be caused your browser\'s security settings. If your web browser\'s &lsquo;Privacy&rsquo; settings are set too high, then your browser will be unable to store (web) cookie information. Check your browser settings to ensure that cookies are allowed.</p>    <p>Running programs that clear internet history, delete other unused files, block cookie creation or that clean up orphaned registry entries may also be responsible for this issue. Disabling such programs will prevent this issue from occurring when logging into Steam via your web browser.</p>    <p><a href="kb_article.php?ref=3658-TPXM-3237" title="Why do I have to enter a Steam Guard code every time I log in?">More information...</a></p>    <p><a name="cantlogin"></a></p>    <h4>What if I can\'t log in once Steam Guard is enabled?</h4>    <p>For help logging into Steam visit <a href="https://help.steampowered.com">https://help.steampowered.com</a></p>    <p><a name="ps3"></a></p>    <h4>Will Steam Guard prohibit me from logging into 3rd party sites that sign in through Steam?</h4>    <p>No, Steam Guard will not limit your ability to access your Steam account through third-party websites that enable&nbsp;a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>sign in via your Steam account credentials.</p>    <p><a name="stolen"></a></p>    <h4>How do Steam Guarded accounts get stolen?</h4>    <p>Steam Guard protects your Steam account by requiring access to your verified email account. This second layer of security depends on your email account also being secure. Below are the common methods used to steal accounts with Steam Guard enabled:</p>    <ol>  \t<li><b>Through Email:</b> If your verified email account is stolen or compromised, a user can enter your account freely provided they know your account name. Knowing your Steam account password would not be required as this can be reset with access to your email account. Never use the same password for both your email and Steam account.</li>  \t<li><b>Acquiring a Steam Guard File:</b> Steam will never ask you to provide any Steam Guard files. If you upload or give a user your Steam Guard .SSFN file, they can gain access to your account without accessing your email account. However, they must know your Steam account password and username to use this file.</li>  \t<li><b>Malware:</b> Hijackers can use malware to gain access to your computer and login to your account using your already authorized device. Since your Steam account could be open or you have your account credentials saved, the hijacker does not need to know anything about your account to gain access. Using a proper anti-virus software with real time protection and avoiding unsafe websites/files will prevent malware from entering your system.</li>  </ol>    <p><a name="notenabled"></a></p>    <h4>Why does Steam report \'Steam Guard not enabled\' while the Steam Guard button is missing?</h4>    <p>This can happen after Steam Support has restored your account. If the button to enable or change Steam Guard\'s settings is missing you must restart Steam.</p>    <p>The Steam client\'s settings dialog will appear like this:</p>    <p><img alt="Steam Guard Not Enabled" src="images/faq/steamguard/sgnotenabled.png" style="border:1px solid grey" /></p>',

            '<div class="section" id="overwhat">  <h3>What is Overwatch?</h3>    <p>Overwatch is an in-game replay review system that lets the CS:GO community regulate itself by allowing qualified and experienced members of the community, called \'Investigators\' to review reports of disruptive behavior, determine whether those reports are valid, and apply temporary bans if appropriate.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="howwork">  <h3>How does Overwatch work?</h3>    <p>Prospective Overwatch Investigators are presented with an active Overwatch button in the main menu, which indicates that there is a pending case for them to evaluate. The Investigators can then choose to participate by watching a replay (eight rounds worth, or roughly 10 minutes) and selecting a verdict.</p>    <p>If the Investigators collectively agree that an offense has occurred, an Overwatch ban will be issued. The ban duration will depend on the severity of the offense and the Suspect\'s history of convictions, if any.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="verdicts">  <h3>What are the charges and possible verdicts?</h3>    <p>There are four distinct charges to be evaluated that cover the major forms of disruption. Each charge has two possible verdicts, \'Insufficient Evidence\' and \'Evident Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\' An Investigator may choose to \'Postpone\' a review and restart it at a later time without a resolution.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="caseend">  <h3>What happens at the end of a case?</h3>    <p>For each charge, if the system determines that the Investigators\' collective judgment agrees on a unanimous verdict, then the case will be closed and all decisions rendered on the case will determine the final verdict. If enough verdicts are &ldquo;Insufficient Evidence&rdquo; or are inconclusive, the case will be thrown out.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="guilty">  <h3>I\'ve been found guilty by Overwatch, what does this mean?</h3>  <div class="warning">  <p>Overwatch bans are non-negotiable and cannot be removed or reduced by Steam Support.</p>  </div>  <p>If you have been found guilty by Overwatch there are two bans you may receive, a Minor or Major Overwatch ban. More information on these can be found in our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5393-TLZX-2230">I\'ve been Overwatch banned</a> help article.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="xp">  <h3>Can I earn XP for participating in Overwatch?</h3>    <p>Yes, you can earn XP by submitting accurate verdicts in your cases. After several of your cases have been resolved, you will receive an XP reward based on the overall accuracy of your recent verdicts, scaled by your Overwatch Investigator score.</p>    <p>You can collect your reward by completing matches and earning XP in any official game mode.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="Investigator">  <h3>How do I become an Investigator?</h3>    <p>Currently, the best way to become an Investigator is to play lots of matches in our official Competitive Matchmaking. We are slowly adding players to the pool of Investigators, and randomly pick them with consideration to their playtime and skill level. The goal is to invite as many skilled reviewers as possible.</p>    <div><strong>Note:</strong> Steam Support cannot add players to the Investigator pool.</div>  </div>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div class="section" id="selection">  <h3>How are Investigators selected?</h3>    <p>New Overwatch Investigators are selected based on their CS:GO activity and account standing. Some factors include:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Competitive wins</li>  \t<li>Account age</li>  \t<li>Hours played</li>  \t<li>Skill group</li>  \t<li>Low report count</li>  </ul>    <p>If applicable, prior Overwatch participation level and score (a function of an Investigator\'s accuracy) will be taken into account. Community members who maintain both a high level of activity and high Overwatch scores will receive more cases to participate in.</p>    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You must maintain an active skill group in order to remain an Overwatch Investigator</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="scores">  <h3>How are Investigators scored?</h3>    <p>An Overwatch score represents an Investigator\'s ability to consistently and accurately judge the evidence they review, per charge, in both real and test cases.</p>    <p>Investigators score positively for agreeing with the majority of other Investigators\' verdicts for the same replay, and score negatively for being in the minority. The resulting change in score is larger when most Investigators are in agreement, and smaller when they disagree. Because of the occasional test case inserted into the case load, the only way to improve an Overwatch score is to carefully watch the entire replay and make an informed and accurate judgment of the evidence provided.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="weight">  <h3>Can one Investigator have more weight applied to their decision than another?</h3>    <p>Yes. A higher-scoring Investigator\'s verdict will carry more weight than a lower-scoring Investigator.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="wanthelp">  <h3>I am not an Overwatch Investigator. How can I help?</h3>    <p>All players can help by reporting disruptive behavior. Reports feed the pool of cases that get reviewed, and good reports result in efficient case reviews.</p>    <p>To file a report, open the scoreboard, use the arrow keys to navigate to a player, and press enter to open their player panel.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="griefing">  <h3>The Suspect is griefing a griefer in retribution. Is the Suspect still guilty of griefing?</h3>    <p>Unequivocally, yes!</p>    <p>Griefing in revenge either escalates an innocent mistake or generates the reaction that the griefer was intending. Additionally, it puts the griefed player in danger of being convicted for the retribution. There is no excuse for poor sportsmanship and your duty as an Investigator is to enforce the highest standards.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="cheatgrief">  <h3>Do griefers and cheaters receive the same penalty when they are convicted?</h3>    <p>No. The penalty assigned to a Suspect is proportional to their behavior. Suspects who are convicted of griefing are given a moderate cooldown, whereas cheaters are removed from the game entirely.</p>    <p>As always, the best way to improve player behavior is to report griefers and cheaters whenever you encounter them.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="jitters">  <h3>Why is the evidence replay sometimes jittery?</h3>    <p>Previously, interpolation, which is used to smooth the transition between the known positions of players, resulted in some situations where the Suspect would appear to get a kill while aiming slightly off-target, even though their aim was actually correct. While we investigate potential smooth and accurate solutions, the interpolation of the Suspect\'s aim was removed from the overwatch demos in order to more accurately represent the Suspect&rsquo;s POV during kills. This may results in a more jittery view in some cases.</p>  </div>',

            "Team Fortress 2 Replay Server Overview",
            "<p>How do I setup a replay server?</p>",
            '<p><u><b><font size="3">Intro</font></b></u><br />  <br />  For a non-technical overview of the replay feature, you can view the press release <a target="_blank" href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/5416/">here</a>.<br />  <br />  At its core, Replay is an extension of SourceTV. The feature must be enabled on the server side, and the &quot;demo&quot; files that are ultimately generated include the full PVS, meaning everyone\'s perspective is recorded. Regular demos, on the other hand, only record the local player\'s perspective.<br />  <br />  At the beginning of the &quot;setup&quot; phase for a round of gameplay, the Replay system will begin recording if enabled (via the replay_enable ConVar). The round, also known as a <i>recording session</i>, is given a unique name based on the date and time of the recording. As the round/recording session progresses, small blocks of data are periodically <i>published</i> to a <i>fileserver</i> where they can be downloaded by clients.</p>  <p><br />  <br />  <u><b><font size="3">Replay File Types</font></b></u><font size="3"><br />  </font><br />  There are two types of files that are published:</p>  <p>1. <b>Recording Session Blocks</b> - These files are essentially compressed chunks of a demo file. When a client saves a Replay, the system figures out how many blocks it needs to download in order to play back the corresponding life. When the client goes to play back a particular Replay, the blocks are decompressed, validated, and written to one monolithic demo file for the game to play.</p>  <p>2. <b>Session Info Files</b> - Each round/recording session has one session info file, which maintain the state of all recording session blocks. The files use the extension .dmx, and are updated every time a block\'s status changes. Clients download the session info file for a particular replay multiple times if all blocks are not available (e.g. if they\'re still being published or not enough time has passed). Session info files also maintain a flag, indicating whether the session is currently recording or not.</p>  <p>There is no client-specific data in recording session blocks or session info files, since any resultant demo file contains everyone\'s perspective. Each client records its own player slot information, so that watching the replay can start from the correct first-person perspective.<br />  <br />  When a client requests to save a replay, they must download all blocks, starting from the beginning of the round. For the curious, the reason for this is that the demo files are &quot;delta compressed&quot; - which means that every &quot;frame&quot; in the demo is dependent on the previous frame. While this is not ideal, it should be noted that clients are smart about which blocks need to be downloaded, meaning that for any particular round, each block will only be downloaded once.</p>  <p><br />  <br />  <u><b><font size="3">Publishing</font></b></u><br />  <br />  There are two ways a Replay server can publish files for clients to download:</p>  <p>1. <b>Local Web server</b> - This method requires the installation of a Web server on the same machine as the game server. To publish a given file, the server will write it to a temporary location on disk, and then move (rename) it to a local path that the Web server sees. If the rename operation fails, the system will explicitly copy to the destination and delete the source file.<br />  <br />  The advantage of this approach is that some may find it more secure, and it requires less work to configure.<br />  <br />  There are several disadvantages to consider here. The main issue is that clients downloading from the Web server may be using bandwidth and CPU needed to run the game server smoothly. This approach is also particularly costly for the game server in terms of bandwidth, since the cost is multiplied by however many clients are downloading the files. Lastly, this approach may open your server up to potential &quot;Denial of Service&quot; attacks if proper security measures are not taken. For faster machines with faster connections, this approach may be preferred.</p>  <p>2. <b>FTP Offloading</b> - The alternative approach requires access to a second machine, which must be running both an FTP server and a Web server. The Replay system will asynchronously offload Replay files from the game server to this second machine via FTP. The Web server must point to the same location on disk so that it can serve the uploaded files to clients.<br />  <br />  The main advantage to this approach is that the burden of serving the Replay data is lifted off of the game server machine and put onto another machine. The bandwidth cost is minimized, since each replay block file is only streamed (uploaded) once, vs the Local Web server approach, where, for example, every single client who saves a replay for a particular round is going to download the first block file.<br />  <br />  FTP is not a secure protocol, so caution should be taken to make sure login credentials do not become vulnerable to exposure.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><u><b><font size="3">Configuring Replay</font></b></u><br />  <br />  The HLDS Update Tool will install three .cfg files with detailed comments in each. You will only need to worry about two of the files.<br />  <br />  replay_local_http.cfg - Edit this file if you plan on using the &quot;Local Web server&quot; method described above.<br />  replay_ftp.cfg - Edit this file if you plan on using the &quot;FTP Offloading&quot; method described above.<br />  replay.cfg - Edit the bottom of this file to execute either replay_local_http.cfg or replay_ftp.cfg. This is the main configuration file for Replay and should be executed on server launch (i.e. &quot;+exec replay.cfg&quot;).<br />  <br />  Regardless of which publishing method you choose for your server, you\'ll need to set the following three ConVars:</p>  <p><b>replay_fileserver_host<br />  replay_fileserver_port<br />  replay_fileserver_path</b></p>  <p>These ConVars are shared with clients and are used to construct the URL\'s for downloading recording session blocks and session info files.<br />  <br />  The URL is constructed using the following as a template:<br />  <br />  http://&lt;replay_fileserver_host&gt;:&lt;replay_fileserver_port&gt;&lt; replay_fileserver_path&gt;<br />  <br />  So, as an example, if you have a Web server running on <i>my.domain.com</i> on port 80, you would set replay_fileserver_host to &quot;my.domain.com&quot; and replay_fileserver_port to 80. replay_fileserver_path should be set to the relative path where replay files will be published, so this would be something like &quot;/&quot; or &quot;/replay&quot;. Note that none of these ConVars should contain &quot;http://&quot;. You also do not want to include any slashes in your replay_fileserver_host.<br />  <br />  If you cannot successfully point a Web browser to the URL constructed by replacing the template above with the values you have specified for the three fileserver ConVars, clients will not be able to download their Replays.</p>  <p><br />  <br />  <u><b><font size="3">Configuring replay_local_http.cfg</font></b></u><br />  <br />  You will only need to edit replay_local_fileserver_path, which is the full path for the Web server. For Apache on a Windows machine, using the replay_fileserver_* ConVars above, this path might be something like: <br />  <br />  &quot;C:\\MyWebServer\\htdocs\\replay&quot;<br />  <br />  On Linux, this might be something like:<br />  <br />  &quot;/path/to/my/web/server/htdocs/replay&quot;</p>  <p><br />  <u><b><font size="3">Configuring replay_ftp.cfg</font></b></u><br />  <br />  You will need to edit the following ConVars, which are used to login and upload and clean up Replay files:</p>  <p><b>replay_fileserver_offload_hostname</b> - The host name of your FTP server.<br />  <b>replay_fileserver_offload_port</b> - The port needed to connected to your FTP server. This is usually 21.<br />  <b>replay_fileserver_offload_login</b> - Your FTP username.<br />  <b>replay_fileserver_offload_password</b> - Your FTP password.<br />  <b>replay_fileserver_offload_remotepath</b> - The path on the FTP server where Replay files should be uploaded. For example, &quot;/users/myusername/replay&quot;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><u><b><font size="3">Testing Your Replay Configuration</font></b></u><br />  <br />  Once you\'ve edited the config files, you can test everything by start a dedicated server, making sure to include <b>+exec replay.cfg</b> to the command line parameters.<br />  <br />  Once the game launches, the Replay system will run a series of self-tests using your configuration. Depending on the publishing method you chose, the system will either try to publish a temporary file to your local HTTP path or publish a file to your FTP server. At the time of this writing, your replay_fileserver_* ConVars will not be validated - you should do this yourself by filling out the template URL noted in the &quot;Configuring Replay&quot; section above and pointing a Web browser to that location.</p>  <p><br />  <br />  <u><font size="3"><b>Cleanup of Stale Replay Data</b></font></u><br />  <br />  Replay files are considered &quot;stale&quot; if they were published more than replay_data_lifespan days ago. An asynchronous cleanup operation is launched in between every round, although it can be cleaned up explicitly using the replay_docleanup command.</p>  <p><br />  <br />  <u><b><font size="3">Frequently Asked Questions</font></b></u><br />  <br />  <b>I want to run a Replay-enabled server. Where do I start? </b>Read this document, from beginning to the end.<br />  <br />  <b>I\'m running multiple servers on the same machine. Is there a way to specify a different directory for each server? </b>Yes. Add -replayserverdir &lt;dir name&gt; to each server command line. The directory name should be something like &quot;server01&quot; or &quot;server02,&quot; and not a full path.<br />  <br />  <b>When a client presses the F6 key, what exactly does that do? </b>On the client side, number of kills, spawn and death ticks, dominations, etc are maintained on a per-life basis. If a life goes by and the client does not press F6, the data is thrown away. If a client does press F6, however, this data gets flagged and is saved to disk. Once the player dies (if they weren\'t already dead when the pressed F6), the death tick is written and the system figures out the maximum recording session block needed to reconstruct a demo that will cover the entire life.<br />  <br />  <b>If no one saves a Replay for a particular round, does the data get thrown away?</b> Yes.<br />  <br />  <b>Does Replay record on an empty server?</b> No. Replay begins recording at the start of the &quot;setup&quot; phase and ends with each round.<br />  <br />  <b>If clients disconnect from my server, will they still be able to download their Replay data?</b> Yes. Since Replay data is served on a Web server (and not on the game server itself), clients can download replays after disconnecting.<br />  <br />  <b>Will executing a changelevel command disrupt recording or publishing of Replay data?</b> No.<br />  <br />  <b>Will shutting down my server mess up Replays?</b> If you shut down your server using the &quot;exit&quot; command, it should publish any data it needs to and shut down gracefully. The &quot;quit&quot; command should work fine, too.<br />  <br />  <b>Is there a way to access the format for the recording session block files and/or session info files? </b>See below.</p>',

            '<div class="section" id="howban">  <h3>How are Overwatch bans issued?</h3>  <p>Overwatch bans are issued when selected members of the CS:GO Community, called \'Investigators\', watch a replay from a reported player\'s match and vote on one or many offenses they believe the player, known as the \'Suspect\', committed.</p>  <p>Overwatch cases are generated based on a number of factors, and once a case is created it is issued to multiple Overwatch Investigators who vote on convictions for griefing, cheating, both offenses, or none. If Overwatch Investigators unanimously agree on a conviction a Minor or Major ban will be issued to the Suspect.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="evidence">  <h3>What evidence is available to Investigators?</h3>  <p>Investigators are shown a replay of a randomly selected eight-round segment from a reported player\'s match. Their task is to determine whether or not that player has committed any offense(s) during that replay.</p>  <p>Suspected players are referred to as \'The Suspect\' and the other players\' names, in-game text, and voice chat are omitted. The Investigator is expected to make a determination solely based on the actions of the Suspect.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="minor">  <h3>I have received a Minor Overwatch ban. What does this mean?</h3>  <p>Minor Overwatch bans are issued for griefing in-game and last a minimum of 30 days. For the duration of your ban you will not be able to play on VAC-secured servers or trade or market your CS:GO items.</p>  <p>After the minimum 30 day ban expires you will again be able to play on VAC-secured servers and trade and market your CS:GO items. Please note, a second Minor Overwatch ban may result in a permanent ban on your account.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="major">  <h3>I have received a Major Overwatch ban. What does this mean?</h3>  <p>Major Overwatch bans are issued for cheating and are permanent. Going forward, you will not be able to play on VAC-secured servers or trade or market your CS:GO items. If you would like to play CS:GO on VAC-secured servers you will need to create a new Steam account.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="suspect">  <h3>How does a player end up being a Suspect in an Overwatch case?</h3>  <p>Players become Suspects when their pattern of being reported exceeds or otherwise stands out from those of their peers. They may have a sudden spike in reports, or they may have built up many reports over a long period of time. Regardless, our data shows the Suspects in Overwatch cases need to be reviewed for a variety of possible offenses.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="appeal">  <h3>Can I appeal my Overwatch ban?</h3>  <p>No. Overwatch bans of any kind cannot be appealed and are not removed at Steam Support. Because bans are only issued when Investigators <i>unanimously</i> agree on a conviction we are confident that applied Overwatch bans should remain. If even one Overwatch Investigator does not agree on a conviction the Suspect will not receive a ban of any kind.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="lowskill">  <h3>I believe I was reported by low skill players for cheating which resulted in my Overwatch ban. Can the ban be removed?</h3>  <p>No. Even if you were reported by lower skill players, Overwatch Investigators are chosen from various higher Skill Groups to ensure we have coverage from a variety of CS:GO player types.</p>   <p>It isn\'t necessary for a player to be exceptionally skilled to be a good Overwatch Investigator. For example, we would expect casters to be good Investigators regardless of their skill level given their experience in observing highly skilled play.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="items">  <h3>Can I move my CS:GO items to a different Steam account?</h3>  <p>No. Items and games cannot be moved from an Overwatch banned account to a different account, however, new games can still be purchased and registered on an Overwatch banned account and the account can still receive items, but not send them.</p>  <p>Players with Minor Overwatch bans can trade and market items once the ban expires. Players with Major Overwatch bans will not be able to trade or market their CS:GO items going forward because the ban is permanent.</p>  </div>',

You must not actively trick them or lie to them or make it difficult for them to find what they are looking for. Your server must report accurate information about itself to the Steam infrastructure and to clients.</p>  </div>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Here are some specific examples of the policy of truth:</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <ul>  \t<li>All of the information in the server browser must be accurate: number of players, number of bots, map, etc.</li>  \t<li>Bots must be easily identified by players as bots. Do not give a bot an avatar or assign it a ping value.</li>  \t<li>Do not name your server according to the naming conventions used by Valve, or any other server organization.</li>  \t<li>The engine uses tags to communicate to clients that certain modifications are in effect. Your server must use these tags properly. If you make these modifications using built-in engine functionality, they will be set automatically, and all you need to do is make sure you don&#39;t actively block them from working. However, if you use a plugin to make gameplay modifications with very similar effects, it is YOUR responsibility to ensure that the tags are set. Players do not care how the gameplay modification was implemented, they just want to know whether it is active or not.</li>  </ul>    <p>Here are some examples of tags that must be set accurately:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>friendlyfire</li>  \t<li>respawntimes</li>  \t<li>norespawntime</li>  \t<li>increased_maxplayers</li>  \t<li>nocrits</li>  \t<li>_registered</li>  \t<li>nodmgspread</li>  \t<li>highlander</li>  \t<li>nodmgspread</li>  </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h4>Malicious server activity</h4>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The following server actions are considered malicious:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Exposing clients to malware or spyware</li>  \t<li>Bypassing of changing cl_disablehtmlmotd</li>  </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h4>Requirements that must be met by quickplay servers</h4>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Servers that want to receive quickplay traffic must meet a few additional requirements. We&#39;ve divided this list into two groups.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h4>Basic requirements automatically enforced</h4>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The first group of quickplay requirements are those that are automatically handled by the engine. If your server doesn&#39;t meet these requirements then you will not get traffic, but you don&#39;t have to worry about getting banned, provided that you obey the Policy of Truth.</p>    <p>Quickplay currently will only match a subset of approved maps, listed below:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Quickplay will only match to servers currently logged into an account, identified by the presence of the &quot;_registered&quot; tag.</li>  \t<li>Your server should not be password protected</li>  \t<li>Your server must have VAC enabled.</li>  </ul>    <p>Quickplay will not match any server with the following tags set:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>friendlyfire</li>  \t<li>highlander</li>  \t<li>trade</li>  \t<li>noquickplay</li>  </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h4>Modifications not allowed in quickplay</h4>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Certain server modifications are allowed for servers listed on the server browser and in the general server population, but not in quickplay. If your server has any of these modifications, it is incumbent on you to ensure that your server is not in the quickplay pool. The easiest way to remove your server from quickplay is to set tf_server_identity_disable_quickplay to 1. Any server in the quickplay pool found to be using these modifications will be considered malicious and banned.</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Opening a MOTD window (hidden or visible) that is not requested</li>  \t<li>Forcing clients to view the MOTD until a timer has expired</li>  \t<li>Giving or selling gameplay advantage to players</li>  \t<li>Kicking players to make room for reserved slots</li>  \t<li>Modifying stock maps, models, or materials</li>  \t<li>Running non-default game modes: prop hunt, dodgeball, etc</li>  \t<li>Enforcing class limits</li>  \t<li>Browser popups</li>  \t<li>Granting or modifying economy items, or taking actions that devalue players&#39; items, or interfering with the TF2 economy</li>  \t<li>Requiring a specific client configuration, cvar value or setting to play on your server</li>  </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="questions"></a></p>    <h4>General Questions</h4>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>How does the Quickplay system decide on where to send potential players to?</h3>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The system takes into account a variety of factors such as: ping to the player, the player&rsquo;s number of hours played, map, current number of players, maximum number of players, and a score we keep for the server.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>What can I do to make my server optimized for Quickplay?</h3>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Make sure your server is eligible and has good network connectivity. Give players a positive gameplay experience.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>If I turn on cvars such as sv_cheats or friendly fire during a map, will that exclude me from Quickplay until they are turned off?</h3>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Yes.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>If I run multiple servers that are registered to the same Steam account, are my servers going to be at a disadvantage in Quickplay?</h3>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>No, each server will be scored independently of each other, regardless of what Steam account they are attached to. However, attaching the game server accounts to the same Steam account will enable us to better audit whether the system is working and potentially modify the scoring.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>Once I enter the provided cvars into my server.cfg, when does Quickplay become active?</h3>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Your server will be automatically included in the Quickplay search as soon as it is up and running and meets the requirements.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>Does Quickplay give empty servers priority over servers with players?</h3>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>All things being equal, having more players is better. However, the algorithm also takes into account past history of the server, ping time, etc.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>Will Quickplay take players to servers that do not have replay enabled?</h3>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Yes.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>I don&#39;t want my server to be matched via quickplay. How can I opt out?</h3>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Set: <code>tf_server_identity_disable_quickplay 1</code></p>    <p>This will cause the the &quot;noquickplay&quot; tag to be set on your server.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>Can I switch tf_server_identity_disable_quickplay on the fly?</h3>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Yes. Turning the flag on should immediately cause your server to cease receiving quickplay matches. When you turn the flag off, there may be a delay of a few minutes before you begin receiving matches again.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>I&#39;ve got two servers configured identically. One is full, the other is empty. What&#39;s up? Quickplay is broken!</h3>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The same thing happens to the Valve servers. The scoring seeks to place players into servers that already have others players in them. This is positive feedback: once one server (by the luck of the draw) gets its first few players, it can continue to receive players while the other, identical server, receives none. The reputation scoring system generates similar positive feedback on a slower time scale. The best way to kickstart your server is to get some people to connect to it.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="maps"></a></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h4>Valve maps that Quickplay accepts:</h4>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h5>Attack/Defense:</h5>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_dustbowl</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_egypt_final</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_gorge</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_gravelpit</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_junction_final</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_mountainlab</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_steel</span></div>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h5>Control Point:</h5>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_5gorge</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_badlands</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_coldfront</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_fastlane</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_freight_final1</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_granary</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_well</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_yukon_final</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_foundry</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_gullywash_final1</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_process_final</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_standin_final</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">cp_snakewater_final1</span></div>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h5>Capture the Flag:</h5>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">ctf_2fort</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">ctf_doublecross</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">ctf_sawmill</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">ctf_turbine</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">ctf_well</span></div>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h5>King of the Hill:</h5>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">koth_badlands</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">koth_harvest_final</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">koth_lakeside_final</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">koth_nucleus</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">koth_sawmill</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">koth_viaduct</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">koth_king</span></div>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h5>Payload:</h5>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">pl_badwater</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">pl_frontier_final</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">pl_goldrush</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">pl_hoodoo_final</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">pl_thundermountain</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">pl_upward</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">pl_barnblitz</span></div>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h5>Payload Race:</h5>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">plr_hightower</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">plr_pipeline</span></div>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">plr_nightfall_final</span></div>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h5>Special Delivery:</h5>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">sd_doomsday</span></div>  ',

            '<h2>For new players:</h2>  <p><b>Q. Who has a free account?</b></p>  <p>Anyone who has downloaded the game for free and has not made a purchase in the in-game Mann Co. Store has a free account.</p>  <p><b>Q. Who has a premium account?</b></p>  <p>If you\'ve ever spent money on Team Fortress 2, you have a premium account. This includes purchasing the game before it was Free-To-Play, receiving the game as a gift that was purchased, activating a retail version, or making a purchase in the Mann Co. in-game store.</p>  <p><b>Q. How is a free account different than a premium account?</b></p>  <p>Premium accounts have a few extra features including access to rare and cosmetic items through random item drops, the ability to store items in your backpack, and more powerful trading and crafting abilities. Otherwise, however, the gameplay experience will be identical for both accounts.</p>  <p><b>Account Comparison:</b></p>  <table width="100%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1">      <tbody>          <tr>              <td>&nbsp;</td>              <td><b>Free</b></td>              <td><b>Premium</b></td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>Backpack:</td>              <td>50 slots</td>              <td>300 slots (expandable up to 1000)</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>Items:</td>              <td>Standard</td>              <td>Standard, Rare, and Cosmetic</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>Crafting:</td>              <td>Limited blueprints, crafted items untradable</td>              <td>All blueprints, all previous and future crafted items tradable</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>Trading:</td>              <td>Receive items only, received items are tradable</td>              <td>Full trading</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td>Gifting:</td>              <td>Can receive gifts</td>              <td>Can send and receive gifts</td>          </tr>      </tbody>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;<b>Q.

How do I play?</b></p>  <p>Install <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">Steam</a>, download <a>Team Fortress 2</a>, and play!

We offer helpful training campaigns that will teach you the basic gameplay mechanics of various mercenaries. We also have a mode that allows you to practice on an assortment of maps with CPU bots at a variety of skill levels.</p>  <p><b>Q. How do I convert my free account to a premium account?</b></p>  <p>Make any purchase of any amount in the in-game Mann Co. Store.</p>  <p><b>Q. Will I need a credit card to play?</b></p>  <p>No, there are no upfront obligations to download and play Team Fortress 2 for free. However, you will need to use one of our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8360-WEJC-2625#acceptedforms">accepted payment methods</a> to fund your <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1122-RTSC-0478">Steam Wallet</a> to make purchases from the in-game Mann Co.

Won\'t going Free to Play mean more griefers and cheaters?</b></p>  <p>We\'re increasing our focus on making sure that hostile players can\'t ruin your fun. Specifically, we\'ll be keeping a close eye on players exploiting the ability to make infinite free accounts to bypass bans. We\'ve built systems that\'ll allow us to measure and track what these players are doing, and respond quickly.</p>  <h2>For existing players:</h2>  <p><b>Q. How does Free-to-Play affect existing users?</b></p>  <p>It doesn\'t. You can keep enjoying Team Fortress 2 as you have before, with all the features and content you\'ve come to expect from Team Fortress 2.</p>  <p><b>Q. What do I get if I paid for the game?</b></p>  <p>To thank you for your years of support we will be giving players who have purchased Team Fortress 2 a special Proof of Purchase hat to wear on any character in-game.</p>  <p><b>Q. How does the Coaching feature work?</b></p>  <p>If a new player on a free account upgrades to a premium account and indicates that you were their most helpful friend, you will receive a special hat. Helping new users via the Coaching feature is a great way to meet new players and help them out!</p>',

The options are public, friends only, or private. You can adjust these settings through your Inventory or your general Profile settings.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="tradegifts">What do you mean by trading Steam Gifts? Can I trade Steam Games?</h3>    <p>Games received as an Extra Copy can be traded to other users. They can be used to trade for other Gifts, or for items in games supporting Steam Trading.  Some older gift purchases on Steam can also be traded.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="usedgames">Does Steam Trading mean I can sell my used games?</h3>    <p>No. Only games that have granted as an extra copy, and thus have never been played, can be traded.

What do I do?</h3>    <p>Steam Support will not return any items or gifts that you feel have been traded unfairly. There are no exceptions to this policy.</p>    <p>To ensure that a scammer is appropriately handled, and to prevent them from benefiting from this scam or others in the future, make sure that you report them through the Steam Community:</p>    <p><a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1927-RTSV-6909">How to Report a Scammer, Hijacker or Phisher</a></p>    <p>Reporting a scammer through the Steam Community will always be better than submitting a Steam Support ticket containing your report. A community report includes the best information about the interaction between the accounts, and is quicker to review and act on.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>To learn more about scams and trading, please see the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3415-WAFH-6433">Scam FAQ</a> and the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8912-WEYU-8454">Recommended Trading Practices</a> article.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="scamshijacks">What\'s the difference between a scam and a hijack?</h3>    <p>A scam is when a user deceives another user into willingly (at the time) completing a trade, market transaction, or sending a gift. After the trade is completed, the person who was scammed either doesn&rsquo;t receive what was promised, or the items involved are not what was agreed upon.</p>    <p>A hijacking is when an account or a computer is taken over by someone else without the account owner&rsquo;s permission. This is often done with malware or a virus. In some cases the hijacker will convince a user to hand over their login information by providing a fake Steam or a third-party trading site. Hijackers most commonly steal accounts to gain items or games, and sometimes commit fraud. Hijackers often use stolen accounts to commit more hijackings. In these cases, we lock the account until the rightful owner contacts us about the hijacking.</p>    <p>For more information on hijacked accounts, please see the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2347-qdfn-4366">Reclaiming a Stolen Steam Account</a> article and the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9958-MJDG-3003">Steam Item Restoration Policy</a>.</p>    <p>For more information on scams, please read the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3415-WAFH-6433">Scam FAQ</a>, <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8912-WEYU-8454">Recommended Trading Practices</a> article and the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9958-MJDG-3003">Steam Item Restoration Policy</a>.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="whatscammers">What happens to scammers?</h3>    <p>If evidence exists that the Steam user is a scammer, Steam Support will ban the account from using the Steam Community, including Trading and using the Steam Market. The length of the ban is dependent on the severity and quantity of the scams. In some cases, scammers will be banned permanently. If a scammer has multiple accounts, all of their accounts may be subject to the ban as well.</p>    <p>In some cases, scammers will hijack an account and use it to commit scams, fraud or more hijackings. In these cases, we lock the account until the rightful owner contacts us about the hijacking.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="wavoidscammers">What are the best ways to avoid getting scammed?</h3>    <ul>  \t<li>Ignore pressure and do not rush the trade. A common tactic by scammers is to force you to trade quickly so they can change items/gifts in the trade without you noticing.</li>  \t<li>Ignore the pressure to trust the other user. If you are trading with a user who insists that you trust them, they are probably attempting to scam you. Please note that +Rep comments can be generated easily by malicious groups.</li>  \t<li>Mouse over every item to ensure that the item/gift\'s properties are correct. Information about the item/gift will be stated here including the quality, name, description and any effects.</li>  \t<li>Pay attention to the trade log while making the trade. All changes, additions, removals and actions will be recorded in this box. You may also use it to communicate with the trader.</li>  \t<li>Ensure that you are trading with the correct user. Scammers may try to impersonate your friends and other trusted traders. It is your responsibility to know who you are trading with.</li>  </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="tradestoavoid">What trades should I avoid?</h3>    <ul>  \t<li>Do not trade for anything that cannot be added into the trade offer itself . The most common examples of these scenarios are the following:</li>  \t<li>Trading items/gifts for money outside of the Steam Community market. You cannot add Wallet credit, PayPal, gift cards or any form of money into the trade offer.</li>  \t<li>Trading items/gifts for CD Keys. You cannot add a CD Key into the trade offer. CD Keys that are offered can be for a different game, fake, used or region restricted.</li>  \t<li>Trading items/gifts for nothing in return in the first trade and expecting to get an item or gift in a later trade. There is no reason to not trade everything in one trade. You may add unlimited items/gifts to a single trade. A common example of this is using a middleman to facilitate a one sided trade.</li>  </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="whattodoscammed">What do I do if I was scammed?</h3>    <p>If you are scammed, please use the Report feature built into Steam:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Go to the profile of the offending user</li>  \t<li>Click the \'More\' drop-down located at the top right of the page</li>  \t<li>Choose &quot;Report Violation&quot;</li>  \t<li>Select the violation (example, &quot;Attempted Trade Scam&quot;) and hit &quot;Submit Report&quot;.</li>  </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="whynotrestore">Why will Steam not return items that were scammed?</h3>    <p>Our community assigns an item a value that is at least partially determined by that item\'s scarcity. If more copies of the item are added to the economy through inventory rollbacks, the value of every other instance of that item would be reduced.</p>    <p>We sympathize with people who fall victim to scams, but we provide enough information on our website and within our trading system to help users make good trading decisions. All trade scams can be avoided.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="tradeban">What is a trade ban?</h3>    <p>A trade ban prevents a Steam account from using the Steam Community, including trading and using the Steam Market. A trade ban can only be applied by a Steam employee. Trade bans are mainly associated with accounts that commit scams.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="probation">What is trade probation?</h3>    <p>Upon receiving a trade ban the offending account gets placed into probation as well. Probationary status allows other users to determine if a user has committed scams in the past so they can make better decisions about whether or not they want to trade with previous scammers. Probationary status does not prevent users from trading.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="baninfo">Why won&rsquo;t Steam Support provide information on why they trade ban or locked an account?</h3>    <p>By limiting the provided data, Steam Support prevents malicious users from learning how to avoid getting caught in the future. Steam Support relies on several data points to arrive at a decision to ban or lock an account. Users intent on committing malicious activity, most often done to other users, are constantly trying to gain this data to use in future scams, fraud and hijackings.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="icanttrade">I can\'t trade! Why not?</h3>    <p>There are different reasons why you may be unable to trade or use the Market. Please see the following <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1047-EDFM-2932">Trading and Market Restrictions</a> article for more information.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3 id="feedback">I have ideas for other things in Steam that can be traded. How do I give that feedback?</h3>    <p>You can post feedback or suggestions in our <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/10/">Suggestions/Ideas forum</a> as it is regularly read by our developers.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>',

No scales, skin pores, fabric textures, super detailed normals, etc. Take a look at giant size of the TF characters hands and imagine what they would build.</li>  \t<li>Try and use flat colors that are close to the <a href="http://www.teamfortress.com/contribute/images/tips_palette.gif">TF color family</a> that the base game uses. Try and avoid full black, full white, or fully saturated colors.</li>  \t<li>Use a subtle vertical gradient and a subtle ambient occlusion layers multiplied over the colors.</li>  </ul>    <p><a name="reportitem"></a></p>    <h4>What types of items should be reported?</h4>    <p>Any inappropriate items, including but not limited to, racism, sexuality, or prejudice.

            "<p>Why does DirectX install with every game?</p>",
            "<h3>Why does DirectX install with every game?</h3>  <p>Running the DirectX installer is not a matter of making sure your overall DirectX install being up-to-date. Microsoft has a helper library with D3D called D3DX. You'll find binaries for this like d3dx9_43.dll in your Windows\\system32 folder. There are over 40 different versions of the D3DX library for D3D9 alone, and many more for D3D10 and 11 as well. Each game that uses the D3DX helper library is linked to a specific version. As such the game must run the correct D3D installer version that it was specifically compiled with to ensure the binaries exist.</p>  <p>Even if a later version of the binary is already installed, that version cannot be used, and even if your DirectX install is up-to-date because you've run a more recent version of the installer that is not guaranteed to have installed all previous versions. Even worse, if a version is installed for x86 it doesn't guarantee the same version is installed for x64, so 64 bit and 32 bit games may need to run the same exact installer version but targeting different platforms when run.</p>  <p>Furthermore, Microsoft's licensing terms prevent anyone from distributing the files directly, the only way to distribute them is to run the installer, that's also the only supported method from Microsoft to check that the correct version installed. Trying to manually check for the correct versions is extremely complicated because there are numerous files that must all be present and individual system configuration options like dll search paths complicate the situation. In addition, the dependencies and required checks may change in each new version of the D3DX runtime. The code to check correctly and repair broken installs all exists in the installer and running it is a guarantee that the correct binaries will exist when you run the game and prevents lots of bad cases where a game would fail to launch with an obscure error if a windows install was either missing the correct version or somehow corrupted in the past.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Why don't Valve's Source Engine games run the DirectX Installer?</h3>  <p>Games which don't use the D3DX helpers (such as Source engine games) don't require running the installer on first launch as they only depend on major d3d9/10/11 versions being installed. However, games that do use D3DX must run it as it's the only way Microsoft has allowed for distributing and checking the version info on the files.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Where can I find more information on this topic?</h3>  <p>More details can be found in <a href=\"http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?p=23759166\" title=\"Steampowered Forums - STOP installing DX\\.net EVERY GAME!\">jmccaskey's original forum post</a>.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "<p>What can I do to make sure that my hardware is running optimally?</p>",
            '<div class="note">  <h3>Note:</h3>  <p>This article is part of a series of articles regarding system and game performance. When troubleshooting performance, please also complete all possible steps in our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9257-TUJL-7421">Troubleshooting Game Performance Issues - Software</a> article.</p>  </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Diagnosing Game Performance Problems</h3>  <p>Game performance problems, such as slow frame rates or occasional slow frames, can be caused by bugs or inefficient coding in the games, or by hardware problems. Before contacting Steam Support to report game performance problems it is worth doing some testing to see if your computer is the source of the issue. Hardware problems don&rsquo;t evenly affect all games, so even if just one game is showing problems it is worth checking your hardware.</p>  <p>These tips all assume that you are running Windows. Some of the tools used are third-party tools that are not controlled by Valve. Valve&rsquo;s mentioning of these tools is not meant to endorse these tools or make any promises about their behavior. The list below is also not meant to be a complete list of the available tools.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>CPU slowdowns</h3>  <p>In some situations your CPU may slow down while you are playing a game. This can be caused by overheating, or it can be caused by attempts to conserve battery power. Sudden slowdowns &ndash; where the game is running fine and then the frame rate drops quite suddenly &ndash; are sometimes caused by these CPU slowdowns. If your frame rate doesn&rsquo;t improve when you lower the game&rsquo;s resolution then the game&rsquo;s performance is probably limited by CPU performance and these diagnostic steps may be appropriate.</p>  <p>Most Valve games have a built-in command for monitoring your CPU speed. If you add "+cpu_frequency_monitoring 2" to your CS:GO command line then the CPU\'s speed will be measured every two seconds. The measured frequency is compared to how fast Windows says that the CPU is running and this percentage is displayed in the <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Cl_showfps">cl_showfps</a> and net_graph displays. Under normal circumstances this percentage should be 90% or higher. If it is 80% or lower then it suggests that your CPU may be overheating and being thermally throttled. If these CPU slowdowns happen when your game is running slowly then it is reasonable to assume that they are the cause and that your CPU is overheating. Since this is a hardware problem (a properly designed PC should never overheat) the only solutions are hardware fixes, such as a better heat sink, better ventilation, etc. If this percentage is above 100% this means that your CPU is overclocking itself (TurboCore or TurboBoost) and is running well.</p>  <p>There are also some third-party tools that can be used to diagnose these problems.<br />  CPU-Z&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html">http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html</a>) is a free tool that shows your CPU&rsquo;s speed in real-time. If you run the game in a window and run CPU-Z beside it then you can monitor the CPU speed and see if it is dropping when the game slows down. Unfortunately, some types of thermal throttling are not correctly measured by CPU-Z.</p>  <p>Since the main cause of CPU slowdowns is overheating, monitoring your CPU temperature is another way to diagnose what is happening. Real Temp (<a href="http://www.techpowerup.com/realtemp/">http://www.techpowerup.com/realtemp/</a>) supports Intel processors only. Core Temp (<a href="http://alcpu.com/CoreTemp/">http://alcpu.com/CoreTemp/</a>) supports both Intel and AMD processors. Note that the maximum temperature allowed may vary considerably between manufacturers and models. See <a href="http://www.alcpu.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=892">http://www.alcpu.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=892</a> for some discussion of this. Temperature monitoring will generally never show your CPU above its limits because modern CPUs slow down to avoid overheating. Anytime that the CPU temperature approaches the limits you should treat that as a likely problem.</p>  <p>If your CPU is overheating then it usually means that the cooling system is not working correctly. This can be caused by poor design (too small a heat sink, or poor ventilation), by poor placement (a PC in a stereo cabinet may not get enough fresh air), or by dust accumulating on the vents, fans, and heat sinks. Make sure that your PC is getting enough cool room air, be careful that vents aren&rsquo;t being blocked by carpet, and perhaps open up your PC and remove clumps of dust, or blow them away with compressed air.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Insufficient memory</h3>  <p>Modern games use large amounts of memory, and gamers often leave many other programs running while playing their games, which can cause even machines with 4 GB or more of memory to be running low. If your system runs low on memory then your game or Steam might start being swapped to disk which can cause repeated frame rate hitches. In addition, if Windows doesn&rsquo;t have many GB of free RAM then it cannot cache frequently used files, which can make level loading take far longer.</p>  <p>As a rule of thumb you should try to ensure that the Available memory (Vista and above only) shown in the Performance tab of Task Manager shows at least 1,000 MB available. Having 2,000 MB or more available is safer. If Available memory goes below about 800 MB then Windows will start writing data to disk in order to make more memory available. Therefore, Available memory will rarely be seen to be below 800 MB, and the safe thing to do is to ensure that it never gets too close to this point.</p>  <p>There truly is no such thing as too much memory. If you have 8+ GB of memory then Windows will cache many files, and level loads and game relaunches will be fast and fluid.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Disk drive slowdowns</h3>  <p>Games sometimes have to read or write data during game play. If the disk drive responds quickly then these disk accesses will cause small or unnoticeable frame rate hitches. However a drive will occasionally take a second or longer to respond, and when this happens it is common for the game to pause for this length of time.</p>  <p>Surprisingly enough, these long pauses seem to happen most frequently with SSDs (Solid State Drives). Some SSDs, particularly those that are almost full, will occasionally do a significant amount of house-keeping at inopportune times. It may be possible to use Resource Monitor to detect this situation. You can run Resource Monitor by typing its name into the Start Menu&rsquo;s search box. Then go to the Disk tab and open up the Disk Activity section. The Response Time column shows how long the disk is taking to respond to requests. If you click this column header it will sort the results by response time and then you can watch, while you are gaming, for excessively long responses that are correlated with frame rate problems. A response time of more than 10-20 ms may start causing performance problems in games.</p>  <p>Some hard drives go to sleep (spin down the platters) after just ten or fifteen seconds of no disk activity. These drives will then take a second or longer to respond to any read requests because they have to get the platters spinning again before they can read any data. These drives can easily cause read delays that are too long for games to hide, and therefore these drives can lead to significant frame rate hitches.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>',

Additionally, Steam Guard must be enabled for 15 days. Please note, redeeming a Steam gift does not grant access to the Community Market.</p>    <p>For a complete list of Market restrictions and requirements to use The Community Market, please view our <a href="kb_article.php?ref=1047-EDFM-2932">Market and Trade Restrictions FAQ</a> and our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663">Limited User Account FAQ</a>.</p>    <p><a name="allitems"></a></p>    <h3>Why don\'t I see all of my items when I try to sell something?</h3>    <p>When selecting an item to sell on the Community Market, only items that are eligible to be sold will be visible. Steam Support is unable to modify items in your inventory to allow them to be sold on the Community Market.</p>    <p><a name="currency"></a></p>    <h3>How are cross-currency transactions handled in the Community Market?</h3>    <p>Sellers will always list items for sale in the native currency of their Steam Wallet, and buyers will always see Community Market prices expressed in the native currency of their Steam Wallet. For items listed for sale in a different currency than the buyer\'s Steam Wallet currency, we apply an exchange rate which we update daily. You must be signed into your Steam account to view the correct currency. If you do not see your local currency on the Community Market this is likely due to never funding your Steam Wallet on the account. You can find out more on how to fund your Steam Wallet by visiting the <a href="kb_article.php?ref=1122-RTSC-0478" title="Wallet FAQ">Steam Wallet FAQ</a>.</p>    <p><a name="viewtransactions"></a></p>    <h3>Where can I see my Community Market transactions?</h3>    <p>Your Community Market history is accessible from the top of the Community Market home page, as well as from your Account Details page in the Steam Store. A receipt for each transaction will also be emailed to you.</p>    <div class="category"><span>Restrictions</span></div>    <p><a name="restrictions"></a></p>    <h3>What kind of Steam Wallet and item listing restrictions apply?</h3>    <p>Currently we are restricting Steam Wallet balances to $2000. In other currencies, the limit will be set to a value close to $2000. We also limit the maximum price of a single listing on the market to $1800 (or similar for other currencies). You will be restricted from listing items for sale in the Community Market if the existing balance in your Steam Wallet, plus the sale price of the item(s), would together exceed the $2000 limit. We may be adjusting the Steam Wallet balance limit, or otherwise changing this restriction, in the future. Note that, if you have multiple accounts, balances for all Steam Wallets associated with all of your accounts will be aggregated for purposes of applying this limit.</p>    <p><a name="prices"></a></p>    <h3>Are there minimum or maximum sales prices for items in the Community Market?</h3>    <p>Currently there is no minimum sales price, although we may decide to impose a minimum price in the future. Currently, the maximum price for any particular item is $1800.</p>    <p><a name="steamguard"></a></p>    <h3>Why is Steam Guard required?</h3>    <p>We require Steam Guard to be enabled for 15 days to help protect your items and Steam Wallet funds from being misused by somebody who may have illicitly obtained your account.</p>    <p><a name="withdrawfunds"></a></p>    <h3>Can I withdraw or transfer funds from my Community Market sales/transactions?</h3>    <p>No. All Community Market sales and purchases are completed using the Steam Wallet. The funds cannot be withdrawn or transferred to another Steam account or to a bank/3rd party account. You may use the funds to purchase Steam gifts to send to other users.</p>    <p><a name="eligibleitems"></a></p>    <h3>Why are some of my items not eligible?</h3>    <p>Newly purchased Dota 2 treasures can’t be sold on the Community Market for the set amount of time noted on their store page. Items gained as timed drops from Dota 2 are permanently not marketable. Some 3rd party games items might not be marketable after purchase. You can select the item in your Steam inventory and read its description to see when it can be marketable.</p>    <p><a name="limited"></a></p>    <h3>Why aren\'t all games on the Community Market?</h3>    <p>It is up to the game developer to decide whether or not they want to participate in the Community Market.</p>    <p><a name="whererestrictions"></a></p>    <h3>Where can I see all of the restrictions that can block me from using the Community Market?</h3>    <p>Please see our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1047-EDFM-2932">Trading and Market Restrictions FAQ</a> for a detailed list of restrictions.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div class="category"><span>Fees</span></div>    <p><a name="steamfee"></a></p>    <h3>What is the &quot;Steam Transaction Fee&quot;?</h3>    <p>The Steam Transaction Fee is collected by Steam and is used to protect against nominal fraud incidents and cover the cost of development of this and future Steam economy features. The fee is currently 5% (with a minimum fee of $0.01). This fee may be increased or decreased in the future.</p>    <p><a name="whopayssteamfee"></a></p>    <h3>Who pays the &quot;Steam Transaction Fee&quot;?</h3>    <p>The buyer pays the Steam Transaction Fee. The Steam Transaction Fee is calculated based on the item cost and is shown on the confirmation page before purchase.</p>    <p><a name="tf2fee"></a></p>    <h3>What is the &quot;Team Fortress 2 Fee&quot;?</h3>    <p>The Team Fortress 2 Fee is a game specific fee that is determined and collected by the game publisher. The Fee is currently set at 10%.</p>    <p><a name="dota2fee"></a></p>    <h3>What is the &quot;Dota 2 Fee&quot;?</h3>    <p>The Dota 2 Fee is a game specific fee that is determined and collected by the game publisher. The Fee is currently set at 10%.</p>    <p><a name="csgofee"></a></p>    <h3>What is the &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Fee&quot;?</h3>    <p>The CS:GO Fee is a game specific fee that is determined and collected by the game publisher. The Fee is currently set at 10%.</p>    <p><a name="artifactfee"></a></p>    <h3>What is the &quot;Artifact Fee&quot;?</h3>    <p>The Artifact Fee is a game specific fee that is determined and collected by the game publisher. The Fee is currently set at 10%.</p>    <p><a id="ItemSaleLimit" name="ItemSaleLimit"></a></p>    <div class="category"><span>Taxes and 200 Item Sale Limit</span></div>    <p><a id="providing1099s" name="providing1099s"></a></p>    <h3>Will you be asking me to provide tax information to you, and/or will you be providing 1099&rsquo;s based on my transactions in the Community Market?</h3>    <p>Previously we required that U.S. citizens and residents provide us with certain information, including name, address and social security number, prior to exceeding 200 separate sales transactions in a calendar year.  We have concluded that this information is not required and we will no longer be asking you for this information as part of Community Market participation.  We will also not be providing IRS Form 1099&rsquo;s with respect to sales activity in the Community Market.</p>    <p><a name="incometaxes"></a></p>    <h3>Do I have to pay income taxes on the proceeds of sales I make in the Community Market?</h3>    <p>Different countries have different rules relating to the taxation of digital transaction. Ultimately, the responsibility for determining any income tax liabilities, which you may or may not have, rests with you. If you are concerned about your liability, please consult a tax advisor.</p>    <p><a name="VATtaxes"></a></p>    <h3>Do I have any obligation to collect or pay sales, VAT, or other transaction taxes based on transactions I engage in in the Community Market?</h3>    <p>Different countries have different rules relating to the taxation of digital transactions. Most jurisdictions do not require individuals to register for, collect or pay sales taxes, VAT or use taxes in connection with occasional sales where they do not qualify as &quot;professional&quot; sellers. However, the ultimate responsibility for determining any tax requirements that may apply to sales you make in the Community Market rests with you. If you are concerned or have further questions about this issue, please consult your own tax advisor. Note: With respect to our administrative fee, if any sales, VAT, or other taxes are due on that payment, we will be responsible for paying those taxes.</p>    <div class="category"><span>Buy Orders</span></div>    <p><a name="commodity"></a></p>    <h3>What is a commodity item?</h3>    <p>A commodity is a kind of item where all the items are identical, and can be traded interchangeably. There aren\'t individual listings for commodity items on the market; instead you place an order to purchase, and an item is selected for you. This is very helpful when trying to buy items that are very frequently traded, and item listings can appear and disappear very quickly.</p>    <p><a name="buyorder"></a></p>    <h3>What is a buy order?</h3>    <p>When buying a commodity items, you specify the price you want to pay, and when an item comes available at that price the purchase completes. If there isn\'t an item available immediately at that price, then that request to purchase stays active until an item listed at the right price comes along. This request to purchase is called a buy order. The buy order price is the maximum amount that will be spent; if an item comes along for a cheaper price, you\'ll only pay that lower price.</p>    <p><a name="buyordersactive"></a></p>    <h3>How many buy orders can I have active?</h3>    <p>You can have up to 10 times your current wallet balance in buy orders active at any time. This is so you can place low-priced buy orders on a lot of items that you\'re interested in. If you don\'t have enough money in your Steam Wallet to fulfill a buy order, that buy order will be automatically cancelled.</p>    <p><a name="buyordersview"></a></p>    <h3>How can I see my buy orders?</h3>    <p>You can see the list of all buy orders you have active on the front page of the Steam Community Market - <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/market/" title="Steam Community Market">http://steamcommunity.com/market/</a> . You can cancel any of your active buy orders from here.</p>    <p><a name="buyordersperiod"></a></p>    <h3>How long do buy orders stay active?</h3>    <p>Buy orders may be cancelled by the system at any time including but not limited to the following reasons:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>if something about the item changes</li>  \t<li>if there are any issues with your wallet balance</li>  \t<li>if there are issues with trying to complete a purchase</li>  \t<li>if something changes about your Steam Account</li>  \t<li>if the buy order results in a purchase</li>  </ul>    <p>You can check on the status of your buy orders at any time by visiting <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/market/" title="Steam Community Market">http://steamcommunity.com/market/</a>.</p>    <p><a name="buyordershelp"></a></p>    <h3>How do buy orders help me?</h3>    <p>Buy orders are helpful in making it easier to buy items - since you don\'t have to choose individual listings, you can choose your price, and you can specify how many of the item you want to buy with each purchase.</p>    <p>Buy orders help with selling, as you can see what other users are willing to pay for an item, and you can choose if you want to do a lower price to sell immediately; or go for a higher price and wait.</p>    <p><a name="buyordersinfo"></a></p>    <h3>How do buy orders choose which listing to buy?</h3>    <p>When you place a buy order, the market first looks for all the cheapest items that can fulfill your order. Then the oldest listing (i.e. the seller who has waited the longest) is selected and purchased. If the items are listed in multiple currencies, the amounts are first converted into your currency before being selected (i.e. a 0.03 RUB listing has no priority over a 0.03 USD listing)</p>    <p><a name="buyordersnewlistings"></a></p>    <h3>If multiple buy orders satisfy a new market listing, which buy order gets processed?</h3>    <p>We have made some changes to how this works in March of 2017, and again in July of 2017 to try to be more fair for users of all currencies.</p>    <p>The oldest matching buy order will be selected. It used to be that the buy order for the highest amount after currency conversion would be selected, but that was unfair to users of some currencies as the maximum amount differs from currency to currency. So now, if multiple buy orders could fulfill a newly-listed item, the oldest buy order will be selected.</p>    <div class="category"><span>Credit Card Verification</span></div>    <p><a name="whatisit"></a></p>    <h3>What is credit card verification?</h3>    <p>Credit card verification allows you to remove market restrictions associated with using a new credit card. After a successful verification, you will regain Market capabilities.</p>    <p><a name="howtoverify"></a></p>    <h3>How do I verify my recently used credit card?</h3>    <p>After using a credit card on Steam to add Wallet funds, please go to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/verifycards">Credit Card Verification page</a> and choose the card you wish to verify. Two pending authorization amounts will be sent to your bank account. These authorizations may take one or two days to appear on your statement. Once they appear, you must enter the exact pre-converted amounts into the two fields on the verification page. Please note that you only have <b>three</b> attempts to input the correct amounts into the verification page.</p>    <p><a name="failattempts"></a></p>    <h3>What happens if I use all three attempts to verify my credit card?</h3>    <p>If you fail to verify the card after three attempts, you will have to wait the normal three day period to use the Community Market. Steam Support cannot override or remove this restriction.</p>    <p><a name="drop"></a></p>    <h3>When will the authorizations be removed from my credit card statement?</h3>    <p>The authorizations will be removed from your credit card statement in 5-10 business days, whether you successfully verified your credit card or not.</p>    <p><a name="conversion"></a></p>    <h3>In what currency do the amounts need to be entered in and how do I get the original pre-converted amounts?</h3>    <p>The verification authorizations are sent to your bank in the currency that your Steam Wallet is in. If the bank converts these to your local currency, you must contact them to request the original amount before any fees assessed by them or conversion made by the bank. The phone number for most banks will be on the back of your credit card.</p>    <p><a name="virtual"></a></p>    <h3>Are virtual online credit cards supported?</h3>    <p>The verification process does not currently support virtual credit cards. You must wait three days to use the Community Market each time you use a virtual card on Steam.</p>    <p><a name="paypal"></a></p>    <h3>What do I do if I used PayPal to fund my Wallet? Can I verify PayPal?</h3>    <p>PayPal cannot be verified through this system. If you fund your Wallet with a PayPal account you will have to wait three days to use the funds on the Community Market.</p>    <p><a name="onecharge"></a></p>    <h3>What do I do if I only see one verification charge?</h3>    <p>You are likely seeing the initial charge which was made to fund your Steam Wallet balance. This is not the verification amount. Your bank may not support our verification system or the charges may not have appeared yet.</p>    <p><a name="banksupport"></a></p>    <h3>What do I do if my bank is unable to help convert or provide the verification charges? Can you help me find them?</h3>    <p>If your bank can\'t provide or assist you with finding the correct verification amounts you will have to wait three days to use the Community Market. Steam Support cannot assist with verifying the funds or provide you with the verification amounts.</p>    <p><a name="howlong"></a></p>    <h3>Once my credit card has been successfully verified through the verification tool, will I ever trigger this restriction again?</h3>    <p>Once you have successfully verified your credit card through our tool you will never trigger this restriction on your account again unless you use a new unverified payment method or PayPal account to fund your Steam Wallet.</p>    <p><a name="paymentmethods"></a></p>    <h3>Which payment methods will trigger this three day payment restriction?</h3>    <p>Only credit cards and PayPal currently trigger this restriction. We recommend using another payment method to purchase Wallet funds if you do not wish to incur this restriction, especially if you are not able to verify you credit card successfully.</p>    <p><a name="keephittingit"></a></p>    <h3>Why do I keep triggering this three day payment restriction when adding funds to my Wallet?</h3>    <p>This can happen if the credit card you are using has not been verified on your account yet. If you are not able to successfully verify your credit card, we recommend using another payment method to fund your wallet such as Steam Gift Cards/Wallet Codes. You can read more about using them in the <a href="kb_article.php?ref=1122-RTSC-0478" title="Steam Gift Cards">Steam Wallet</a> article.</p>    <p><a name="whatifIwait"></a></p>    <h3>Will my credit card and/or PayPal account become \'verified\' once the three day restriction ends?</h3>    <p>No, the only way to verify your credit card is through our <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/verifycards">verification tool</a>. If you do not successfully verify your credit card through this tool you may hit this restriction again in the future.</p>    <p><a name="giftcards"></a></p>    <h3>How do I verify a gift card that has a limited amount of funds?</h3>    <p>In order to complete credit card verification, you\'ll need between $3 and $4 USD remaining on the card. In 5-10 business days, the money will be returned to the card. If you cannot complete credit card verification yourself, you will have to wait three days until the restriction is removed automatically.</p>    <div class="note">  <h3>Still Have Questions?</h3>    <p><span style="font-family: Arial">Check out the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/community_market">Community Market Group</a> with user discussions and official announcements.</span></p>  </div>',

            '<p>The latest client release includes support for using Primus to run Steam client games. To take advantage of this you will need to install Primus for Bumblebee on your system. For installation instructions, see <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee</a> or <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2012/11/primus-better-performance-and-less.html">here</a>.</p>  <p><b>Note </b>- Primus must be installed with 32-bit support because Steam for Linux (and most games downloaded from Steam) are 32-bit.</p>  <p>To verify that Primus is available on your system, run the following command: <b>primusrun glxspheres</b>.</p>  <p>There are two methods for using Primus with Steam. The first method involves running Steam on the Intel GPU and only selected graphically intensive games on the discrete GPU.</p>  <p>To make a game run using the discrete GPU, use these simple steps:</p>  <ol>      <li>Select a game - that you want to run using your discrete Nvidia card - from the <b>Library </b>page of the Steam client, right-click, and select <b>Properties</b>.</li>      <li>Click the <b>SET LAUNCH OPTIONS...</b> button and specify <b>primusrun %command%</b> for the command line.</li>      <li>Save your changes.This method allows you to pick when the discrete NVidia GPU should be used on a per-game basis.</li>  </ol>  <p><br />  The second method is not as efficient (in terms of power consumption) but quicker by running the Steam client and all games using Primus. From the command line, enter <b>primusrun steam</b> instead of <b>steam</b>. This is inefficient because all games do not require the power of an NVidia card and power consumption is greatly increased during a Steam client/game session.</p>  <p>For more information about instaling and configuring Primus (and installing Steam on Ubuntu, 64-bit), see this <a href="http://cjenkins.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/steam-for-linux-on-optimus-enabled-computer-running-ubuntu-12-04-64bits">article</a>.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>',

            '<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 15px"><b>What is SteamPipe and why do I care?</b></span></p>',
            "<h2>General questions</h2>  <h3>Q. What&rsquo;s happening?</h3>  <p>We have upgraded Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, and Half-life 2: Deathmatch to be delivered through SteamPipe, Steam&rsquo;s new content distribution. This will change how the game is downloaded, and how it is stored on your computer.  The benefits to players are:</p>  <ul>      <li>Faster downloads</li>      <li>Faster map load times and much faster boot times</li>      <li>Easier distribution, installation, and management of mods</li>  </ul>  <h3>Q. Do I need to do anything?</h3>  <p>Some users might need to take special action:</p>  <ul>      <li>Users who customize game files for custom HUDs, hitsounds, skins, etc. will need to move some files to a different folder.  (See below.) \t<br />      &nbsp;</li>      <li>Gameserver operators will need to switch to the new download tool, Steamcmd, and be aware of how the changes to the filesystem affect any customizations they have made. \t(Please see the separate <a href=\"https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2519-IGXC-8453\">FAQ for gameserver operators</a>. \t<br />      &nbsp;</li>  </ul>  <h3>Q. Will I have to download the entire game again?</h3>  <p>No.  A one-time conversion process will occur, which will take a bit longer than the usual download.  You should expect your computer to do a lot of disk work, and you will need enough free hard drive space for about two full copies of the game.  (For TF, around 15GB free is recommended.)</p>  <p>With SteamPipe, the shared Source engine files are no longer shared between games.  So if you have multiple Source engine games installed, the size of disk will increase by a few GB.</p>  <h3>Q. Where did the game move to?</h3>  <p>Previously, each user had a folder that contained several game files.  For example,<br />  <br />  <code>[steam installation directory]/steamapps/[username]/team fortress 2/</code>.<br />  <br />  When the game is converted to SteamPipe, the installation directory is shared between users.  The directory will probably be something like<br />  <br />  <code>[steam installation directory]/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/</code>.</p>  <p><b>NOTE:</b> In this article, we will use folder names particular to Team Fortress 2 in the examples.  The same principles apply to all of the games being converted, so just replace &quot;<code>tf</code>&quot; with &quot;<code>dod</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>cstrike</code>&quot;, or &quot;<code>hl2mp</code>&quot;</p>  <h3>Q. What happened to the .GCF files?</h3>  <p>SteamPipe does not use .GCF files.  Instead, content is packed up into VPK files, which are similar to .zip files.  VPK files are used by other Valve games such as DOTA2, CS:GO, and Left4Dead 2.  VPK files are also used on the dedicated server.</p>  <h2>Common problems</h2>  <h3>Q. The conversion process crashed steam, what do I do?</h3>  <p>Give it some time.  On some users' computers, one step in the conversion process is taking much longer than we anticipated (sometimes 15 minutes or more). Steam may become unresponsive during this time.</p>  <h3>Q. My custom HUD broke.  How do I fix it?</h3>  <p>Create a directory in <code>tf/custom</code>.  For example, <code>tf/custom/my_custom_stuff</code>.  Locate your custom HUD files.  After the conversion process, they should be in the <code>tf/download</code> folder.  Move the custom files that are part of your HUD to the custom folder.  For example, the files that were in <code>tf/download/resource/</code> should be moved to <code>tf/custom/my_custom_stuff/resource/</code>.  The folder name &quot;my_custom_stuff&quot; is of your choosing; see below for more info.</p>  <h3>Q. My custom hitsound broke.  How do I fix it?</h3>  <p>Move your custom hitsound to a directory such as <code>tf/custom/my_custom_stuff/sound/ui/hitsound.wav</code>.  The folder name &quot;my_custom_stuff&quot; is of your choosing; see below for more info.</p>  <h3>Q. My server browser and console are all screwed up.  How do I fix it?</h3>  <p>Look for a custom version of <code>SourceScheme.res</code> on your computer.  Some custom HUDs need customize this file.  The shipping verison of the file has changed, and the custom version may not be compatible anymore.  Delete or rename the <code>SourceScheme.res</code> file.</p>  <h3>Q. TF2 is taking up a huge amount of space on my HDD.  What happened?</h3>  <p>For most users, TF2 should take less space than before after the conversion process.  Here are some places to look for wasted disk space:</p>  <ul>      <li>Look for <code>steamapps/[username]/team fortress 2/</code> folders, which are no longer used.  Confirm that any custom files \t\thave successfully been moved to <code>steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/</code>, then you can safely delete the username folders.</li>      <li>Look for Source Engine, Half Life 2, and Team Fortress 2 .GCF files in the <code>steamapps</code> folder.  The TF2 ones can be safely deleted.  The \t\tSource engine and Half Life ones might still be needed if you any HL2-baed games installed on your computer that have not ben converted to SteamPipe.</li>  </ul>  <h3>Q. My XYZ file got deleted.  Where did it go?</h3>  <p>The convesion process does not delete any user files.  For most users, it should move them into the <code>steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/</code> folder. If there was a problem with the conversion process, they might stil be in <code>steamapps/[username]/team fortress 2/</code>.</p>  <h2>Customization</h2>  <h3>Q. Can I still download custom maps and other files from gameservers?</h3>  <p>Yes, and we've improved how this works.</p>  <p>Files downloaded from gameservers will go into the <code>tf/download</code> folder.  This segregates downloaded files from shipping files and your own customizations.</p>  <h3>Q. What will happen to files I already downloaded or customized?</h3>  <p>The conversion process can't tell which custom files you downloaded from a server, and which you intentionally customized.  To be on the safe side, it will move all custom files into the <code>tf/download</code> folder.</p>  <p>If you have customized a shipping file, however, you will need to move it from the <code>tf/download</code> folder into a subfolder under the <code>tf/custom</code> folder.  (This is described in the next question.)</p>  <h3>Q. Can I still customize any game file?</h3>  <p>Yes.  Create a folder such as <code>tf/custom/my_custom_stuff/</code> and put your custom files there.</p>  <p>For example, you might customize the scoreboard by extracting the <code>resource/ui/scoreboard.res</code> file from the appropriate VPK (using the VPK tool in the <code>bin</code> folder, or a free tool such as <a href=\"https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/GCFScape\">GCFScape</a>) as <code>tf/custom/my_custom_stuff/resource/ui/scoreboard.res</code>, and then modifying it.  When the game boots, it will see the subdirectory <code>my_custom_stuff</code> and add that folder as a search path.  Then your version of <code>resource/ui/scoreboard.res</code> will take priority over the official shipping version of the file.</p>  <p>You can have more than one such subfolder under <code>tf/custom</code>, (for example, you might be working on two different customization projects and don&rsquo;t want to get the files mixed up), but each folder is another search path added in front of the VPKs will slow down load times a little more.  When you&rsquo;re done tweaking your customization, you can always pack it up into a VPK and delete the subfolder.</p>  <h3>Q. Why can't I just edit files directly in the game folder like I did before?</h3>  <p>Modifying files directly in game installation folders (<code>tf/resource</code>, <code>tf/materials</code>, etc) won't always work anymore.  Here's why.</p>  <p>Previously, when the engine looked for a file, it would <i>first</i> search folders on your hard disk, and <i>then</i> look inside the Steam GCF files.  This meant that custom files in the <code>tf</code> folder would take priority over the files in the GCF.</p>  <p>This method had two disadvantages:</p>  <ol>      <li>It slowed down loading, because the vast majority of files were in the GCFs.  Booting \t\tthe game or loading a level would cause many thousands of operating system calls to attempt to \t\topen files, most of which would fail.</li>      <li>Files from many different sources were mixed together.  (Files you intentionally customized, \t\tfiles downloaded from gameservers you visited, files from third party mods, and any official shipping games files that were \t\tnot in the GCF.)  Removing a mod was difficult because the files were scattered across several directories.  This problem will be \t\texacerbated with SteamPipe, because more game files are shipped loose on disk than was the case when GCF's were used.</li>  </ol>  <p>The new system searches VPK files first, and <i>then</i> search folders on your hard disk. This reduces load times significantly.  But it means that the file in the VPK's we ship will always take priority over loose files in the <code>tf</code> folder.</p>  <p>Users interested in understanding the filesystem search paths in more detail should take a look at <code>tf/gameinfo.txt</code>.</p>  <h3>Q. Can custom content be put into VPK's?</h3>  <p>Yes!  And this is the recommended method.</p>  <p>Installing a mod distributed as a VPK is easy: just copy the VPK file to the <code>tf/custom</code> folder.</p>  <h3>Q. How can I create a VPK?</h3>  <p>The VPK tool ships with the client, in the <code>bin</code> folder.  It's a command line tool, but there is one easy way to use it without any typing.  If you drag a folder onto the executable, it will create a VPK with the same name as the folder, with the contents of the folder.</p>  <h3>Q. I have a mod distributed as a .zip.  The instructions say to unzip it directly into my game folder.  Should I?</h3>  <p>Probably not.  First, check if the mod you are installing is available in VPK format.  If so, then download the VPK and put it into your <code>tf/custom</code> folder.</p>  <p>If the mod you want to use is only available in a .zip format, then unzip it into a subdirectory under the game's <code>custom</code> folder.  For example, if the .zip contains custom player models that look like (<i>heaven forbid</i>) ponies, and one of the files is <code>materials/models/player/scout/scout_head.vtf</code>, then you might make a directory such as <code>tf/custom/i_love_ponies</code>. You should unzip the mod such that the custom scout head texture ends up at <code>tf/custom/i_love_ponies/materials/models/player/scout/scout_head.vtf</code>.</p>  <p>Don't unzip the .zip directly into the <code>custom</code> folder!  Make a subdirectory!</p>  <ol>      <li>Create a subdirectory in the <code>tf/custom</code> folder.  For example, <code>tf/custom/lots_of_custom_stuff</code></li>      <li>Copy the directory structure under <code>tf</code> into the new directory you created.  For example, the files that were in the <code>tf/materials/</code> folder should end up in <code>tf/custom/lots_of_custom_stuff/materials/</code>.</li>  </ol>  <h2>Bugs</h2>  <h3>Q. Where do I report a bug or give feedback for these changes?</h3>  <p>For issues particular to gameservers, please send an email to the HLDS mailing list.  (You can subscribe to this mailing list <a href=\"https://list.valvesoftware.com/mailman/listinfo/hlds\">here</a>.)</p>  <p>Otherwise, please communicate your feedback using the <a href=\"https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games\">github bug database</a>.</p>  <h3>Q. What are the known issues?</h3>  <p>Known bugs:</p>  <ol>      <li>The dedicated server might fail to load the Steam libraries the first time you boot it. \tBooting it a second time will fix the problem.</li>      <li>The SDK and content creation tools have several major problems.  Please bear with us, we are going \tto get these fixed soon.  \tWe don't have any intention of abandoning our content creators!</li>  </ol>",

            '<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 15px"><b>What do gameserver operators need to know about the Steampipe conversion?</b></span></p>',
            '<h3>Q. What’s happening?</h3>  <p>We are upgrading TF2, DoD:S, CS:S, and HL2:MP to be delivered through SteamPipe, Steam’s new content distribution.  This FAQ concerns issues particular to gameservers.  Please see the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7388-QPFN-2491">general  FAQ</a> for more info      </p><h3>Q. How do I get the dedicated server?</h3>  <p>SteamPipe does not use the HLDSUpdatetool executable.  The new tool is steamcmd.exe.  Many server operators are probably  already familiar with this tool, since it’s used by CS:GO.  You can download the tool and read  instructions on how to use it <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD">here</a>.</p>     <p>All of the Source engine games will allow anonymous login for the dedicated server.  Below is an example SteamCMD script  you could use to download the dedicated server.  Replace <code><i>[app_id]</i></code> with the appropriate number from  <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Supported_Servers">this table</a>,  and <code><i>[base_install_path]</i></code> with the directory where you want to install the server.</p>    <p>  <code>  @ShutdownOnFailedCommand 1<br />  @NoPromptForPassword 1<br />  login anonymous<br />  force_install_dir <i>[base_install_path]</i><br />  app_update <i>[app_id]</i><br />  quit<br />  </code>  </p>    <p>  The directory structure created will look something like this:<br />  <br />  <code>  <i>[base_install_path]</i>/srcds.exe<br />  <i>[base_install_path]</i>/dod/<br />  <i>[base_install_path]</i>/dod/gameinfo.txt<br />  <i>[base_install_path]</i>/dod/materials/<br />  <i>[base_install_path]</i>/dod/models/<br />  <i>[base_install_path]</i>/dod/custom/<br />  <i>[base_install_path]</i>/hl2/materials/<br />  <i>[base_install_path]</i>/hl2/models/<br />  </code>  <i>etc.</i>  </p>  <p>There is no automated conversion process for the dedicated server.  It will be a full re-download.</p>    <p>  The Source engine games do not use the "mod" feature of SteamCMD.  Each game has its own AppID and is a seperate installation  with no shared content.  </p>    <h3>Q. How can I test the TF beta if my favorite server plugin isn\'t compatible?</h3>  <p>  All server plugins <i>should</i> be compatible between TF Release and TF Beta.  The two branches of the game might be  slightly out of sync with each other, but other than the app ID and a few version numbers, they are identical.  (Previously, the beta used a different gamedir, “tf_beta”, which was a source of incompatibility.  This is no  longer the case.  The beta directory structure is identical to the release game.)  If a server plugin doesn’t  work on the new TF Beta, it should only be for reasons related to the SteamPipe changes, not for reasons peculiar  to the beta.  There should be no work required to port between the beta and release version of the game.  So if  a server plugin works with the beta, then it *should* work when we convert the release game to SteamPipe.  </p>    <h3>Q. How does the new dod/downloads directory work for gameservers?</h3>  <p>The <code>dod/download</code> folder is only used on the <i>receiving</i> side of a file transfer.  When a file is uploaded  (almost always from a gameserver to a client) it can originate from any search path visible to the engine.</p>     <p>The only class of file that typically are sent from clients to gameservers are user sprays.  They go in the  <code>dod/download/user_custom</code> directory.  They are no longer stored in a flat directory structure, so the OS filesystem  won’t get stressed out so quickly if you have a lot of visitors and accumulate a lot of sprays.</p>     ',

            "<p>OpenGL allows for different methods of handling sending rendering commands. &nbsp;Direct rendering is often faster and more desirable, so the Linux Steam client checks to see which mode OpenGL is running in when it starts. &nbsp;If it sees that OpenGL is running indirectly it will display a warning to let you know that you may want to change your configuration to allow it to run directly and thus usually with better performance. &nbsp;There are a few reasons why OpenGL may not be able to use direct rendering:</p>  <ol>      <li>If you are running over a remote connection. &nbsp;In this case it is required to use indirect rendering.</li>      <li>If your OpenGL binaries or driver are misconfigured, for example if your 32-bit and 64-bit OpenGL libraries are incorrectly set up. &nbsp;This can happen if you have switched between compatibility and native OpenGL libraries, or if an installation or driver update failed or applied itself improperly. &nbsp;      <ul>          <li>In order to test whether this is an issue on your system you'll need to open a terminal window and locate the 32-bit version of glxinfo. &nbsp;When you run glxinfo the first few lines will say whether direct rendering is supported or not. &nbsp;glxinfo may also print warnings which might relate to the problem, such as a driver version mismatch. &nbsp;As Steam is a 32-bit binary it is important to make sure you're running the 32-bit glxinfo when you do this to match how Steam uses OpenGL. &nbsp;If you do not have a 32-bit glxinfo you can install the mesa-utils:i386 package.</li>          <li>Another way to gather useful diagnostic info is to find glxinfo and see what it will load. &nbsp;You can use 'which glxinfo' to find your glxinfo binary and then 'ldd glxinfo' to determine which OpenGL libraries will be loaded for it (this is also a way to distinguish a 32-bit glxinfo from a 64-bit one). &nbsp;Check the dependency list to see what libGL.so and driver binaries are being used and this may show mismatches or unexpected dependencies which could shed light on why OpenGL is not running in direct rendering mode.</li>          <li>Finally, setting the environment variable LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose can help diagnose OpenGL issues, so that output may give some clues.</li>      </ul>      </li>      <li>On some systems your user must be part of the 'video' group. &nbsp;If there is a video group and you are not a member try joining the group, logging out and logging back in and see if that helps.</li>  </ol>  <p>Uninstalling and reinstalling your video driver is one way to try and get a fresh configuration and may correct problems such as version mismatches between kernel and user components.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>",

For more specific information, read the Steam Trading Cards FAQ here: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq/">http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq/</a></p>  <p><a name="0"></a></p>  <h3>What are Steam Trading Cards?</h3>  <p>Steam Trading Cards are virtual cards, earned by buying and playing games on Steam, that can be crafted into badges that grant rewards. Collect a set of cards to earn items that help you customize your profile and show off your gameplay.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>How can I get trading cards?</h3>  <p>You can get trading cards simply by playing one of the <a href=" http://store.steampowered.com/search/?category1=998&amp;category2=29">participating games</a>. As you play, you\'ll occasionally receive trading card drops which will be placed in your Steam Inventory.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Is there a limit to how many trading cards can drop?</h3>  <p>Most games will drop a number of cards equal to about half the number of cards in that game\'s set of cards. For example, Half-Life 2 has 8 cards in its set, you can receive 4 card drops by playing it. You\'ll need to collect the other half of the set from other community members. You can check how many drops you have remaining on your Badges page.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Do free to play games drop trading cards?</h3>  <p>Free to play games drop game cards based on your in-game purchasing. For every $9 USD spent (approximate) since the launch of the game\'s trading cards, you will earn one card drop. This card will drop at some point as you play.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Why is my free to play game purchase not granting drops?</h3>  <p>DLC from the Steam Store will not grant additional trading card drops for a free to play game. The only purchases that qualify are those completed through the in-game store.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>',

            '<div class="section" id="whycool">  <h2>Why are Competitive cooldowns issued?</h2>  <p>Competitive cooldowns exist to ensure that Counter-Strike matches are enjoyable for all players on the server. When a player commits actions which negatively impact the match and players in the match, they may receive a Competitive cooldown which keeps them from playing Competitive and Scrimmage matchmaking for a set period of time.</p>   <p>Competitive cooldowns will be issued regardless of whether or not an infraction was intentional and explicit warnings are given to players before committing an action that will result in a cooldown.</p>  <p>Competitive cooldowns are issued for the following reasons:</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="server">  <h3>Failing to stay connected to the server</h3>  <p>Any player who cannot remain connected or reconnect to the server in time will receive a Competitive cooldown. This may be caused by network, technical, or local issues with your machine, but any time a player leaves a Competitive server and does not reconnect in time a Competitive cooldown will be issued.</p>  <p>If you are experiencing network or technical issues that are causing Competitive cooldowns we suggest troubleshooting those issues before attempting to play another Competitive match. Please see our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1456-EUDN-2493">Troubleshooting Network Connectivity</a> article for more information.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="newplayer">  <h3>New players may win two Competitive matches in 24 hours</h3>  <p>New players may win 2 Competitive matches in 24 hours before receiving an intentional Competitive cooldown. This cooldown exists to limit the impact new accounts can have on Competitive and Scrimmage matchmaking.</p>   <p>After 10 Competitive wins the new player cooldown is removed and there is no limit to the number of Competitive wins you may earn in 24 hours.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="kicker">  <h3>Kicking too many teammates</h3>  <p>Competitive cooldowns are issued to players who kick too many teammates in Competitive matches. Regardless of if you called the vote or only pressed \'F1\' to kick the player, doing this too often will result in a Competitive cooldown for your account.</p>   <p>Cooldowns for kicking too many teammates are <i>only</i> issued to players abusing the vote kick option. We have a number of systems in place to ensure these types of cooldowns are issued correctly, and if you find yourself playing with abusive teammates we suggest reporting them in-game instead; calling votes to kick a teammate should only be done in extenuating circumstances.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="kickee">  <h3>Being kicked from too many matches</h3>  <p>If you are kicked from too many Competitive matches your account will receive a Competitive cooldown. Like kicking too many teammates, there are systems in place to ensure cooldowns of this kind are <i>only</i> issued to players being kicked an excessive amount.</p>   </div>    <div class="section" id="abandon">  <h3>Abandoning matches</h3>  <p>Explicit warnings are shown to players who wish to abandon Competitive matches. Choosing to abandon an incomplete Competitive match will result in a Competitive cooldown for your account.</p>  <p>Users experiencing network or technical issues may be disconnected from Competitive matches, resulting in a cooldown for abandoning or failing to reconnect to the match in time. </p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="afk">  <h3>Being AFK or not participating in matches</h3>  <p>A player in a Competitive match who is AFK or not participating may be removed by the server. When this happens a Competitive cooldown will also be issued. If you find yourself needing to step away we recommend asking your teammates to call a timeout.</p>   </div>    <div class="section" id="removecool">  <h2>Can my Competitive cooldown be removed?</h2>  <p>No. Regardless of the reason a Competitive cooldown was issued they cannot be removed from an account. You will need to wait for the cooldown to expire before you can again queue for Competitive matches.</p>   </div>    <div class="section" id="length">  <h2>How long will my Competitive cooldown last?</h2>  <p>Competitive cooldowns in CS:GO have four levels. When an account receives a Competitive cooldown, the cooldown level remains on the account for a one-week probationary period. Any additional cooldowns received during the one-week probationary period increases the amount of time players are restricted from matchmaking:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>First cooldown (level 1) - lasts 30 minutes</li>  \t<li>Second cooldown (level 2) - lasts 2 hours</li>  \t<li>Third cooldown (level 3) - lasts 24 hours</li>  \t<li>Fourth cooldown (level 4) - lasts 1 week</li>  </ul>  <p>A week of clean play will reduce an account\'s cooldown level by one. An account whose cooldown level has been reduced to level 2 through clean play would receive a level 3 (24 hour) cooldown on their next infraction.</p>  <p>Please note that cooldown levels can exceed level 4. Players whose cooldown level exceeds level 4 will need an extended period of clean play to have their cooldown level reduce beneath level 3.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="level">  <h2>How do I determine my current cooldown level?</h2>  <p>Your current cooldown level can be determined by the length of the last cooldown you have received:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>My last cooldown lasted 30 minutes - you are currently at level 1</li>  \t<li>My last cooldown lasted 2 hours - you are currently at level 2</li>  \t<li>My last cooldown lasted 24 hours - you are currently at level 3</li>  \t<li>My last cooldown lasted one week - you are currently at level 4 (or above)</li>  </ul>  </div>  &nbsp;  <div class="section" id="vacbans">  <h2>VAC bans</h2>  <p>Players who have been VAC banned can find information in the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4044-QDHJ-5691">I\'ve been VAC banned</a> article.

If an account is already at the max five-game penalty, a matchmaking ban will be applied in addition, preventing matchmaking of any kind.</p>    <h3>What if technical issues are resulting in game abandons?</h3>  <p>We know this happens, and we\'ve built in a small threshold to accommodate occasional abandons. A single abandon will not put you into low priority.</p>  <p>If you are continuing to experience technical issues that result in abandons, it is important to keep in mind that this is causing a bad game for the other 9 players as well. We encourage you to address the underlying issue, so that you can complete the game penalty free, while also making sure that the other players can complete the game as well.</p>  <p>Read the following articles for general information on how you can ensure that your PC is capable of completing a game successfully:</p>  <ul>  \t<li><a href="http://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7720-IOAM-7915">Troubleshooting Dota crash & performance issues</a></li>  \t<li><a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4292-UFXV-9228">Troubleshooting Networking & Connection issues</a></li>  </ul>',

            '<h3><a name="whatisoffer"></a>What is a trade offer?</h3>    <p>A trade offer is a prepackaged trade that you can send to a friend. You select the items to trade from your inventory and the items you&rsquo;d like to receive from your friend\'s inventory, and send the trade offer. Your friend can then choose to accept, decline, or make a counter offer. Unlike regular Steam Trading, you don\'t need to both be online at the same time. Plus, trade offers can be sent and received using a web browser.</p>    <h3><a name="howtosendoffer"></a>How do I send a trade offer?</h3>    <p>You can create and send a trade offer from two places: the Trade Offers page within your Inventory or from a friend&rsquo;s profile.</p>    <p>To send an offer from your Trade Offers page:</p>    <ol>  \t<li>Open Steam (either the client or via the web)</li>  \t<li>Hover over your persona name at the top</li>  \t<li>Click on Inventory</li>  \t<li>Click on Trade Offers</li>  \t<li>Click on New Trade Offer</li>  \t<li>Select the friend you\'d like to make a trade offer to</li>  \t<li>Click and drag the items you wish to trade from both inventories into the trade boxes</li>  \t<li>Check the box to confirm the trade contents</li>  \t<li>Click on Make Offer.</li>  </ol>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>To send an offer from a friend\'s profile:</p>    <ol>  \t<li>Open Steam&nbsp;(either the client or via the web)</li>  \t<li>Hover over your persona name at the top</li>  \t<li>Click on Friends</li>  \t<li>Click on the friend you\'d like to send a trade offer to</li>  \t<li>Click on More</li>  \t<li>Click on Offer a Trade</li>  \t<li>Click and drag the items you wish to trade from both inventories into the trade boxes</li>  \t<li>Check the box to confirm the trade contents</li>  \t<li>Click on Make Offer.</li>  </ol>    <p>You\'ll then need to confirm the trade offer. If you\'re using a Mobile Authenticator through the Steam Mobile App on your smartphone to protect your account, you can confirm via the app. Otherwise you\'ll receive a confirmation request via email.</p>    <p style="text-align: left;">Once you confirm the trade, the offer will be sent.</p>    <h3><a name="optout"></a>How can I opt-out of confirmations?</h3>    <p>To ensure that you are in control&nbsp;of items moving out of your account, trade offers must be confirmed. There is no longer a way to opt out.</p>    <h3><a name="sendwhooffer"></a>To whom can I send a trade offer?</h3>    <p>You can send trade offers to any of your friends with an Inventory that you can view or anyone who has given you their Unique Trade URL. You can find your own Unique Trade URL on the bottom of your <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/my/tradeoffers/privacy">Who can send me Trade Offers?</a> settings page.</p>    <h3><a name="whatoffer"></a>What can I put in a trade offer?</h3>    <p>Any tradable items in your inventory.</p>    <p>Note that you cannot include Steam Wallet funds in a trade or trade offer. If someone sends you a trade offer claiming to include Steam Wallet funds it may be a scam. You can report scammers using the &quot;Report Violation&quot; link on their profile.</p>    <h3><a name="howreceiveoffer"></a>How do I view my trade offer?</h3>    <p>When you receive a trade offer, your mailbox in the top right corner of the Steam interface will turn green. To see the offer, click on the mailbox and select &ldquo;pending trade offer&rdquo;. You can also view pending offers and your offer history from the Trade Offers page in your Inventory.</p>    <h3><a name="itemsremovedoffer"></a>Are items in a trade offer temporarily removed from my inventory like the market?</h3>    <p>No. Items in a trade offer remain in your inventory until an offer is accepted or cancelled.</p>    <h3><a name="multipleoffers"></a>Can I send more than one offer with the same items?</h3>    <p>Yes. You can send more than one offer containing the same items. When an offer is accepted any other pending offers with the same items will change from pending to inactive and be moved into your Offer History.</p>    <h3><a name="unavailableoffer"></a>What happens to an offer when an item is no longer available?</h3>    <p>If a trade offer contains an item that is traded away or sold on the market, the trade becomes inactive and can no longer be accepted. It will automatically be moved into your Offer History.</p>    <h3><a name="changeoffer"></a>How do I change or counter an offer?</h3>    <ol>  \t<li>From your Inventory, select Trade Offers</li>  \t<li>Select Incoming Offers</li>  \t<li>Select Respond to Offer</li>  \t<li>Select Change Offer</li>  \t<li>Add or remove items from either or both Inventories</li>  \t<li>Select Confirm trade contents</li>  \t<li>Select Send Counter Offer.</li>  </ol>    <p>The counter offer will be sent back as a new trade offer.</p>    <h3><a name="canceloffer"></a>How do I cancel an offer I\'ve sent?</h3>    <ol>  \t<li>From your Inventory, select Trade Offers</li>  \t<li>Select either Incoming Offers or Sent Offers and identify the trade you want to cancel</li>  \t<li>Select Cancel Trade Offer at the bottom, right-hand corner of the trade offer window.</li>  </ol>    <p>You can cancel a pending offer you\'ve sent from the Sent Offers area of the Trade Offers page.</p>    <h3><a name="unhappyoffer"></a>What if I&rsquo;m unhappy about a trade I made?</h3>    <p>All trades are final; use the confirmation step to review and make sure you\'re satisfied with the offer.</p>    <h3><a name="expirationoffer"></a>How long is an offer good for?</h3>    <p>Trade offers automatically expire after two weeks. You can find the offer expiration date at the bottom of a pending offer.</p>    <h3><a name="historyoffer"></a>Where can I see my trade history?</h3>    <p>You can view your trade history from the Trade Offers page or from the &ldquo;More&rdquo; drop down in your Inventory.</p>',

            "<h4>What is an audio plugin?</h4>  <p>Audio plugins are typically divided into two groups, effects and virtual instruments (aka synths). Effects often emulate real-world hardware like EQs, Compressors, Reverbs, etc. They can be use in the same way as their hardware counterparts and often offer even more flexibility due to the nature of software. Virtual instruments are software-based instruments that can be played right within your DAW (and often standalone). You can access realistic instrument sounds like drums, piano, electronic keyboards, basses, and more using virtual instruments. Virtual instruments give musicians access to instruments that they normally wouldn&rsquo;t have access to due to budget or space constraints in their studio.</p>  <h4>Can I use audio plugins within a DAW?</h4>  <p>Yes, plugins can be used within a DAW and most plugins require a DAW to host them.  DAWs that run on Windows PCs usually support VST or Direct X plugins.  DAWs that run on Apple computers typically support Audio Units plugins.</p>  <h4>Can an audio plugin generate sound?</h4>  <p>Yes, this is often referred to as a soft synth or virtual instrument plugin. Effects typically process or effect the sound (thus the name).</p>  <h4>Can I use audio plugins in different DAWs?</h4>  <p>Plugins come in many different formats such as VST, VST3, RTAS, DXI, AAX, AU. Every DAW is typically compatible with at least one of these formats.</p>  <h4>What is the limit of audio plugins I can use in a song?</h4>  <p>The limit to the amount of audio plugins that can be used in a single song is not quantifiable and depends on the following details:</p>  <ul>      <li>The amount of RAM that the computer uses</li>      <li>Limitation of the DAWs simultaneous plugin count</li>  </ul>  <h4>Are audio plugins as good as hardware?</h4>  <p>Yes, audio plugins have come to a point in time where their engineering has become equal to most hardware devices. Software also offers more flexibility to do things that hardware units sometimes cannot such as save your instrument/effect settings within a given audio project.</p>",

Select a game and click &quot;Play&quot; to request access to that respective Library.</p></li>  \t<li><p>Requesting access will send the game owner an email with a link to allow you to play games in their Library.</p></li>  \t<li><p>Click the link in the email to authorize that computer and grant their Steam account access to your games.</p>  \t<p><img src="http://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/support/faq/family_sharing_request.jpg" width="600px;" /></p></li>  </ol>    <a name="howtomanage"></a>  <h4>Managing Family Sharing devices and users</h4>  <p>You can log into the Steam client and visit the &quot;Family&quot; tab in Settings, where you\'ll find a button to &quot;Manage Other Computers...&quot; Here you can deauthorize any computer or account that\'s been authorized to share your library.</p>  <p>Or, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/managedevices">remotely deauthorize computers from the web</a>. Visit your Account Details online, and then select &quot;Manage Family Library Sharing&quot;. Using either the client or the web site, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/managedevices">view all currently authorized devices</a> and accounts and disable any or all of them.</p>    <h5>Disabling Family Sharing</h5>  <p>In these same settings, deselect any account from the list of authorized users to prohibit them from accessing your games.</p>    <a name="faq"></a>  <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>  <ul>      <li><a href="#dontlivewithme">Can I share my games with users that don\'t live with me?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#inuse">I want to play my own games, but they\'re being played by another account.

What do I do?</h5>  <p>As the owner, you may always access and play your games at any time. If you decide to start playing when another user is already playing one of your games, he/she will see a message giving them five minutes to either purchase or quit out of the game.</p>    <a name="gamevslibrary"></a>  <h5>Can I share specific games?</h5>  <p>No, libraries are shared in their entirety. You aren\'t able to select specific games to share or exclude.</p>  <p>Additionally, for users that are borrowing multiple Steam Libraries, they will be unable to choose who they borrow a game from.</p>    <a name="excludedgames"></a>  <h5>Can all Steam games be shared?</h5>  <p>No, due to technical limitations, some Steam games may be unavailable for sharing.</p>  <p>For example, titles that require an additional third-party key, account, or a subscription in order to play cannot be shared between accounts.</p>  <p>DLC may not be shared if the borrower also owns the base game.</p>  <p>Free to play games and any purchased DLC for those games is also not supported for Family Sharing.</p>  <p>In addition, if your account has a VAC ban, you will be unable to share any VAC protected games.</p>    <a name="simultaneous"></a>  <h5>Can two users share a library and both play at the same time?</h5>  <p>No, a shared library may only be played by one user at a time including the owner and even if they want to play different games.</p>    <a name="sharelimit"></a>  <h5>Is there a limit to the number of accounts I can share my Library with?</h5>  <p>Yes. A Steam account may authorize Family Library Sharing on up to 5 accounts and on up to 10 devices in a 90 day period. This includes accounts/devices that you have cancelled sharing with in that same time period.</p>    <a name="dlc"></a>  <h5>DLC and in-game content</h5>  <p>A borrower will have access to the lender\'s games and DLC, but only if the borrower <b>does not</b> also own the base game. If a they already own the game, they\'ll need to purchase the DLC themselves in order to play it. For free to play games, DLC cannot be shared since all Steam users "own" the game.</p>  <p>Any user may purchase, trade, earn, or otherwise acquire in-game content while playing a game, but in-game items cannot be shared between accounts. These items remain the property of the account that purchased or acquired them.</p>  <p>Trading cards will not be dropped while playing a shared game.</p>    <a name="regionrestriction"></a>  <h5>Can region-restricted games be shared across regions?</h5>  <p>No, any region restrictions will remain in place when lending or borrowing games.</p>    <a name="VACban"></a>  <h5>What if a borrower is caught cheating or committing fraud while playing my shared games?</h5>  <p>Your Family Sharing privileges may be revoked and your account may also be VAC banned if a borrower cheats or commits fraud. In addition, not all VAC protected games are shareable. We recommend you only authorize familiar Steam Accounts and familiar computers you know to be secure. And as always, never give your password to anyone.</p>  <div class="important">If you receive a VAC ban, you will be unable to share <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/search/?category2=8">any VAC protected games</a>.</div>    <a name="trouble"></a>  <h4>Troubleshooting Family Sharing</h4>  <p>If you are experiencing issues with an entire shared library, it\'s likely that there is an authorization issue with device or user that was previously authorized.</p>  <p>If you are experiencing an issue with a specific game or DLC in a shared library, it\'s likely that the game is not available for sharing for one of the reasons outlined in the FAQ above.</p>    <h5>Re-authorizing a shared library</h5>  <p>This is always a good first step to ensure that Family Sharing is working correctly.</p>  <ol>  \t<li><p>The owner of the shared library needs to access their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/managedevices">Device Management</a> page. From there, select &quot;Manage Family Library Sharing&quot; and deauhtorize the device that is giving you issues.</p></li>  \t<li><p>Now, the borrower should attempt to launch one of the games in the shared library which will open request to share.</p></li>  \t<li><p>Requesting access will send the game owner an authorization email.</p></li>  \t<li><p>They need to click on the link in the email to authorize that computer and grant access to the library.</p></li>  </ol>    <h5>Shared library locked</h5>  <p>This is an error indicates that someone else is using the shared library. A Steam library can only be used by one user at a time to play one game at a time. The same is true if that library is being accessed by another user via Family Sharing.<p>    <h5>Rate limit exceeded</h5>  <p>A Steam account may authorize Family Library Sharing on up to 5 accounts and on up to 10 devices in a 90 day period. This includes accounts/devices that were previously shared to and have since been cancelled. In order to add a new authorization to Family Sharing after having reached the limit, users will have to cancel an existing link and then wait out the 90 day cooldown period.</p>    <p>You will need to wait for the cooldown to expire before authorizing another machine. Steam Support does not remove these cooldowns</p>     <a name="bugs"></a>  <h4>Reporting an issue with Family Sharing</h4>  <p>If you have an issue with Family Sharing and wish to discuss it with the community, use the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/familysharing/discussions">Family Sharing Community Discussion</a> forum.</p>  <p>If you have a new bug or issue that you wish to report, use the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/familysharing/discussions/1/ ">Family Sharing Bug Reports</a> section of the Steam Discussion forums.</p>  <p>Should you continue to have issues, please contact <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php?category=372">Steam Support</a>.</p>',

Even if a hijacker manages to access your account, you can prevent them from stealing your items by canceling any transactions that are on hold.</p>    <p><a name="cancelled"></a></p>    <h3>Recently Cancelled An Accepted Trade</h3>    <p>If you choose to cancel any of your accepted trades that are in a trade hold, your account will be restricted from trading for 7 days for your protection.</p>    <p><a name="limited"></a></p>    <h3>Limited User Accounts</h3>    <p>Limited users are prevented from accessing several features on Steam. We\'ve chosen to limit access to certain features as a means of protecting our users from those who abuse Steam for purposes such as spamming and phishing.</p>    <p>Please see the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663">Limited User Accounts</a> article to learn more.</p>    <p><a name="newdevice"></a></p>    <h3>Newly Authorized Device</h3>    <p>If you are logging onto Steam from a device that has not been previously authorized by Steam Guard (log in confirmed via email), you will not be able to trade or use the Community Market from this device for 7 days. Any other devices that have already been authorized for at least 7 days will still be able to trade and use the Community Market.</p>    <p>Actions such as clearing your web browser cookies, using a new web browser, reinstalling Steam, and reformatting your computer will make that device look new to Steam and will trigger this restriction.</p>    <p>Exceptions: If you have had a Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator on your account for at least 7 days, there will be no trading or Market restrictions for using new devices/computers. This is because you\'ll confirm trades and Market listings from the mobile app.</p>    <p><a name="nosteamguard"></a></p>    <h3>Steam Guard Not Enabled</h3>    <p>We require Steam Guard (via email or mobile authenticator) to be enabled for 15 days to help protect your items and Steam Wallet funds from being misused by someone who may have illicitly obtained your password. If you have not had Steam Guard enabled for 15 days, you will be unable to trade or use the Community Market. Accounts that currently have Steam Guard disabled will be unable to trade and use the Community Market.</p>    <p><a name="recentsteamguard"></a></p>    <h3>Steam Guard Only Recently Enabled</h3>    <p>If you have recently enabled Steam Guard via email on your account, you will be unable to use the Community Market for the 15 days after Steam Guard was enabled. Removing Steam Guard or disabling and re-enabling Steam Guard will also trigger this restriction.</p>    <p><a name="reset"></a></p>    <h3>Recent Password Reset</h3>    <p>If you forget your password and need to reset it (note: this is different than changing your password), you will be restricted from trading and the Community Market for 5 days. If your account has not had any activity for more than two months, these restrictions will apply for 30 days. We do this to help protect users who lose access to their email account.</p>    <p>You can change your password from the settings panel in the Steam Client. This restriction only applies to password resets, ex: done via https://help.steampowered.com or by Steam Support.</p>    <p><a name="appadded"></a></p>    <h3>Mobile Authenticator Added</h3>    <p>A Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator provides additional security for your account. Adding an authenticator does not immediately remove existing restrictions. Trades created within the first 7 days of adding the authenticator will still have up to a 15 day trade hold. This allows your items to still be protected and gives you time to recover your account if a malicious actor were to ever add an authenticator to your account.</p>    <p>If your account was already protected by Steam Guard via email, you will have no new restrictions from using trading or the Community Market. If your account was not protected by Steam Guard via email or mobile app, you will be restricted from using trading and the Community Market for 15 days because Steam Guard has been recently enabled.</p>    <p><a name="appremoved"></a></p>    <h3>Mobile Authenticator Removed</h3>    <p>Removing a Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator reduces your account security. To help protect your items, you will be unable to trade or use the Community Market for 15 days. In the case your account was compromised, this cooldown gives you time to recover your account and reinstate your security without losing your items.</p>    <p><a name="newpay"></a></p>    <h3>Newly Added Payment Method</h3>    <p>Items that are purchased with trusted payment methods may or may not have a cooldown before they can be traded or used in the Community Market. This cooldown period varies and is game dependent. A payment method that has been verified using Steam\'s card ownership verification tool is considered trusted. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/verifycards">Verify your credit card here</a> and gain access to the Community Market. Verification amounts are sent to your bank in the currency that appears in your Steam store. If your bank converts the charges into your local currency, please contact them for the pre-converted amounts.  </p>  <p>  Unverified payment methods will be subject to a 3 day waiting period before purchases can be made on the Community Market. </p>    <p><a name="purchase"></a></p>    <h3>No Purchase Older Than 7 Days</h3>    <p>Your account must have a successful purchase older than 7 days, but not older than a year in order to access the Community Market. The purchase of wallet funds, games, DLCs and software meet this requirement. Activating a Steam Wallet Code or Gift Card on your account to add funds to your Steam Wallet also meet this requirement. Retail CD key activation and gift purchases do not satisfy this requirement.</p>  <p>Any purchase that is charged back on your account will reset this restriction. Only purchases after the most recent chargeback will be considered for purposes of this restriction.</p>    <p><a name="ban"></a></p>    <h3>Current Trade or Community Ban</h3>    <p>You also may be unable to trade or use the market if your account has been banned from trading by Steam Support. Depending on the severity of the violation, you may receive a temporary or permanent trade ban.</p>    <p><a name="vac"></a></p>    <h3>VAC Ban</h3>    <p>If a VAC Ban, cooldown or overwatch ban has been registered on your account, you will no longer have access to the CS:GO store, or be able to make trades for CS:GO items, and you will no longer receive item drops.</p>    <p>Steam Support cannot remove a VAC ban.</p>    <p>See the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-Radz-6869">VAC FAQ</a> and the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4044-QDHJ-5691">I\'ve Been Banned</a> article to learn more about VAC Bans.</p>    <p><a name="email"></a></p>    <h3>Email Change</h3>    <p>Changing your account email address will restrict trading for 5 days.</p>    <p><a name="games"></a></p>    <h3>Additionally</h3>    <ul>  \t<li>Items purchased in-game or on the Community Market will not be tradable or marketable until after the date indicated on the item <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/my/inventory">in your Inventory</a>.</li>  \t<li>Dota 2 - Timed drops are not tradable or marketable.</li>  </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>',

            '<h4>Trade Up Contracts</h4>  <div class="section" id="whataretuc">  <h3>What are Trade Up Contracts?</h3>  <p>Trade Up Contracts allow players to trade 10 normal or StatTrak weapon skins of the same weapon grade (Mil-Spec to Classified) for one weapon skin of the next highest weapon grade from one of the weapon collections used in the trade up.</p>   <p>To use a Trade Up Contract, left-click on an eligible weapon and select \'Use With Trade Up Contract\'.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="whatitemstuc">  <h3>Which weapon skins can be used in Trade Up Contracts?</h3>  <p>A Trade Up Contract requires all ten weapons to be the same weapon grade (Mil-Spec, Restricted, or Classified) and either normal or StatTrak. Normal weapon skins cannot be used in a Trade Up Contract with StatTrak weapon skins and vice versa.</p>  <p>To verify if a weapon can be used in a Trade Up Contract, hover over the weapon in your CS:GO Inventory and look for the Collection it\'s included in. If the weapon\'s grade is the highest in its Collection it can <i>not</i> be used in a Trade Up Contract.</p>  <p><b>Note:</b> Covert (red) weapon skins can not be used in Trade Up Contracts.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="weaponwear">  <h3>The skin I received isn\'t the weapon wear I\'d like. Why is this?</h3>  <p>Regardless of the weapon wear on the skins you\'re trading up, the weapon wear on the skin you receive will be randomized, meaning you may receive a Battle-Scarred skin even if you trade up all Factory New skins. This result is always randomized and cannot be controlled by trading up skins with a specific weapon wear.</p>  </div>    <h4>Name Tags</h4>  <div class="section" id="whatarent">  <h3>What are Name Tags?</h3>  <p>Name Tags in CS:GO are single use in-game items which allow players to nickname their weapons. Name Tags cannot be modified once they\'ve been applied to a weapon.</p>  <p>To remove a Name Tag on an existing weapon, left-click on the weapon, select \'Rename\', then \'Remove Name\'.</p>  <p>Name Tags can be purchased for $1.99 USD in-game or from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/">Community Market</a>.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="characters">  <h3>What characters can I use on a Name Tag?</h3>  <p>The following characters can be used on Name Tags:</p>  <ul>  <li>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</li>  <li>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</li>  <li>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</li>  <li>`!@#$%^&*-+=(){}[]/|\\,.?:;\'_ (and "space", but Name Tags can\'t start with spaces)</li>  </ul>  <p><b>Note:</b> Any characters not listed here are not supported on Name Tags and may not display properly.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="tagposition">  <h3>Can I change the position of the Name Tag on a weapon?</h3>  <p>No. Name Tags have a pre-determined location on each weapon which cannot be changed.</p>  </div>    <h4>Stickers</h4>  <div class="section" id="whatarestick">  <h3>What are Stickers?</h3>  <p>Stickers in CS:GO are single use in-game items that can be applied to one of four locations on each weapon.</p>   <p>Stickers can be scraped once they\'ve been applied to a weapon to change their appearance. To do this, left-click on a weapon in your CS:GO Inventory which has Stickers, select \'Scrape Sticker\', and click on the Sticker you\'d like to scrape.</p>  <p>Stickers can be purchased through in-game offers or from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/">Community Market</a>.</p>  <p><b>Note:</b> Scraping a Sticker cannot be undone - once you have clicked on a Sticker to scrape it the results are permanent.</p>   </div>    <div class="section" id="movesticker">  <h3>I have applied a Sticker and would like to move it. Can I do this?</h3>  <p>No. Once a Sticker has been placed on a weapon it cannot be moved. If you\'d like to remove the Sticker you will need to scrape it in-game until the \'Remove Sticker\' option appears.</p>   <p><b>Note:</b> Removing a Sticker from a weapon is permanent and the Sticker will not be returned to your Inventory.</p>   </div>    <div class="section" id="stickergone">  <h3>Stickers on my weapon are not visible when I inspect in-game. Why is this?</h3>  <p>Stickers on your weapon may not be visible because they\'ve been heavily scraped. When Stickers are scraped they lose their vibrance and eventually won\'t be visible on the weapon when inspecting it. Stickers that have been heavily scraped will only leave an outline of the original sticker.</p>   <p>You\'re free to completely remove the sticker by scraping it further using the in-game UI.</p>   </div>    <h4>StatTrak Swap Tool</h4>  <div class="section" id="swaptool">  <h3>What is a StatTrak Swap Tool?</h3>  <p>StatTrak Swap Tools are single use items which allow players to transfer kill counts from one StatTrak weapon skin to another so long as the weapon is the same. Kills from a StatTrak M4A1-S can only be transferred to another StatTrak M4A1-S using a Swap Tool, <i>not</i> to another weapon.</p>  <p>StatTrak Swap Tools can be purchased for $.99 USD in-game or from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/">Community Market</a>.</p>  </div>    <h4>Graffiti</h4>  <div class="section" id="graffiti">  <h3>Graffiti information</h3>  <p>Detailed information about CS:GO Graffiti can be found in our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7737-ukvb-0657">Graffiti Help Article</a>.</p>  </div>    <h4>Storage Units</h4>  <div class="section" id="whatissu">  <h3>What are Storage Units?</h3>  <p>Storage Units are in-game items used to expand and better organize your CS:GO Inventory. A Storage Unit adds an additional 1,000 item capacity to your CS:GO Inventory.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="howdoisu">  <h3>How do I get a Storage Unit?</h3>  <p>Storage Units can be purchased in-game for $1.99.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="whoneedssu">  <h3>Who needs a Storage Unit?</h3>  <p>Any user who wants to hold more than 1,000 items in their CS:GO Inventory will need a Storage Unit. Even if you have not reached the 1,000 item Inventory limit, Storage Units can be labeled and used as a way to more effectively organize your CS:GO Inventory.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="depositsu">  <h3>How do I deposit items to a Storage Unit?</h3>  <p>There are two ways to deposit items into a Storage Unit:</p>  <ul>  <li>Click on an item in your Inventory, select \'Move to Storage Unit\', and select the Storage Unit you would like to move the item to.</li>  <li>Click on the Storage Unit in your Inventory and select \'Deposit Items\', then select which items you would like to add to the Storage Unit.</li>  </ul>  <b>Note:</b> default weapons, agents, gloves, and Music Kits cannot be added to Storage Units, and any item in a Storage Unit will not appear in your Steam Community Inventory until it is retrieved.  </div>  &nbsp;    <div class="section" id="retrievesu">  <h3>How do I retrieve items from a Storage Unit?</h3>  <p>There are two ways to retrieve items from a Storage Unit:</p>  <ul>  <li>Click on a Storage Unit in your Inventory and select \'Retrieve Items\', then click on the item(s) you would like to retrieve.</li>  <li>Click on a Storage Unit in your Inventory and select \'Inspect\', then select the item(s) you would like to retrieve and click RETRIEVE at the bottom of the screen.</li>  </ul>  </div>  &nbsp;    <div class="section" id="whereretrieve">  <h3>I retrieved an item but can not find it in my Inventory. Where did it go?</h3>  <p>When items are retrieved from a Storage Unit they are added back to your CS:GO Inventory in the same location they were prior to being deposited. Retrieved items will not appear at the top of your CS:GO Inventory.</p>  <p>If you can not find the retrieved item we suggest scrolling through your Inventory or searching for the item using \'Search Items\'. It is not possible to lose items you are depositing or retrieving from Storage Units because they never leave your account.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="interactsu">  <h3>How can I interact with items placed in a Storage Unit?</h3>  <p>Any item in a Storage Unit cannot be equipped, consumed, traded, marketed, renamed, or altered until it is retrieved to your Inventory.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="tradesu">  <h3>Can I trade or market items in a Storage Unit?</h3>  <p>No. Storage Units are singular in purpose and only meant for holding items. Storage units with or without items cannot be traded, marketed, or deleted from an account.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="renamesu">  <h3>How often can I rename a Storage Unit?</h3>  <p>Storage Units can be renamed as often as you would like. To rename a Storage Unit click on it in your Inventory and select \'Change Label\'.</p>  </div>    <h4>Patches</h4>  <div class="section" id="whatarepatches">  <h3>What are Patches?</h3>  <p>Patches in CS:GO are single use in-game items that can be applied to any Agent you own.</p>  <p>Once applied, a Patch’s location cannot be changed; the Patch can only be removed from the Agent. Like Stickers on a weapon, any Patches applied to an Agent will remain if it is bought or sold on the Steam Community Market.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="movepatch">  <h3>I have applied a Patch and would like to move it. Can I do this?</h3>  <p>No. Once a Patch has been applied it cannot be moved. If you would like to remove a Patch you will need to click ‘REMOVE PATCH’ in-game.</p>  <p><b>Note:</b> Removing a Patch from an Agent is permanent and the Patch will not be returned to your Inventory.</p>  </div>      <div class="section" id="whichagents">  <h3>Which Agents can I apply Patches to?</h3>  <p>Patches can be applied to any Agent you own but cannot be applied to default (local) agents.</p>   <p>A link to Community Market listings for Agents that Patches can be applied to can be found <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=730&q=Agent">here</a>.</p>  </div>',

If you need help with a replacement part or a purchased accessory, <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithHardwareAccessory" target="_blank">go here</a> for replacement, return or support options.</p>    <div class="content-section">  \t<h2>WARRANTY REPAIRS or REPLACEMENT</h2>  \t<p>You must notify Valve of your warranty claim via the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamHardware">Steam Help Site.</a> Prior to shipping or transporting the Hardware to Valve, provide (upon request) a dated sales receipt for the Hardware, and satisfy all other terms and restrictions set forth in the Limited Warranty (“Warranty”).  There is a link to the Warranty at the end of this document.  In the United States of America and Europe, Valve will provide a return shipping address, prepaid shipping label for the outside of the box you ship, and an RMA (Returned Materials Authorization) label, which must be placed inside the box you ship. In other countries, you must return the Hardware to your retail place of purchase or as we may otherwise direct.</p>  \t<p>Hardware must be transported or shipped to a Valve-designated service center in either the original packaging or in equally protective packaging. Provided the Hardware requires repair or replacement and such repair or replacement is covered by this Warranty, Valve will be responsible for the costs of shipping repaired or replacement Hardware back to you. If the Hardware does not require repair or replacement, you will be responsible for the costs of shipping the Hardware back to you. If you send your Hardware, but do not include all components or requested information, it could delay your repair, and cost you shipping costs to send the requested components or information so that Valve may repair the Hardware. If the Hardware does require repair or replacement, but the Warranty does not apply (e.g., due to misuse), Valve will contact you regarding replacement options and associated costs and payment options, including the costs of shipping the Hardware back to you. Valve will not return Hardware that is shipped to Valve without pre-authorization or return any part or Hardware that is replaced pursuant to the Warranty.</p>  </div>      <div class="content-section">  \t<h2>Repair or Replacement</h2>  \t<p>If your Hardware has issues, please follow the steps below to see if your unit needs to be replaced:</p>  \t\t<ol>  \t\t\t<li>Go to the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamHardware">Help Site</a></li>  \t\t\t<li>Select your <em>Steam Hardware Device</em></li>  \t\t\t<li>Select your issue to begin troubleshooting</li>  \t\t</ol>    \t<p>If your unit has experienced a hardware failure or unrecoverable firmware error, you can request a replacement device.</p>  \t<p>Once initiated, you will receive an automatically generated, pre-paid shipping label along with further shipping instructions.

Where did they go?</h3>    <p>By default, Steam will always try to use your Steam Wallet funds first when a purchase is made. On the purchase confirmation screen, if you do not switch your intended payment method away from the wallet, your wallet funds will be spent. Check your purchase confirmation emails for all of your recent purchases for more information.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="xtrac"></a></p>    <h3>I already own one of the games in a package that I wish to purchase. Do I get an extra giftable copy of that game?</h3>    <p>Unless otherwise stated, you will not receive extra giftable copies for duplicate purchases on a single Steam account.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="split"></a></p>    <p>For various reasons, such as common issues, incompatibility with non-Steam versions, or regional restrictions that are required by the game\'s developer or publisher, some games and addons cannot be gifted.</p>    <p>All multi-pack offers, such as 2, 3, and 4-packs, contain between one and three giftable subscriptions and one subscription towards your own account. If you already have the subscription on your account, you will not be able to purchase the multi-pack, even if your intention is to send all copies as gifts.</p>    <div class="important">  <h3>Important:</h3>    <p>Steam Support cannot modify the giftability of a game or package for a single user.</p>  </div>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>Can I split a package of games into individual gifts?</h3>    <p>Steam packages cannot be split in any way. All items in the package are added to a single account.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="missedsale"></a></p>    <h3 id="missedsale">I recently purchased a game that is now on sale. Can I refund the difference?</h3>    <p>We are unable to refund the difference in price; however, you <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966">may request a refund</a> for the initial gift and repurchase it at the current sale price.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="ownershipcheck"></a></p>    <h3>The Steam Store shows that I own a special edition of a game (GOTY, deluxe, etc.) but I cannot locate the additional content.</h3>    <p>Due to current technical limitations, The Steam Store may show that you own a special edition of a game when you actually only own the base version. You can check your purchase/activation history to determine which version of this game you own using the following method:</p>    <ol>  \t<li>Log in to your Steam account through the Steam application.</li>  \t<li>In the upper right hand corner, click your profile name; and select &quot;Account Details&quot; from the drop down list.</li>  \t<li>Click on &quot;Store Transactions&quot; to list your Steam Store transactions. If you have made any purchases for in-game items or currency &quot;Game Transactions&quot; will list those purchases. The details include the date of purchase, name of the game or item(s) purchased, and the transaction amount.</li>  </ol>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>I have a coupon that I wish to use. Does it stack with a Steam Sale?</h3>    <p>Unless clearly stated otherwise, promotions such as coupons or loyalty discounts do not stack with Steam Sale pricing.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="wishlist"></a></p>    <h3>I\'m concerned that I may miss a sale for a game that I want. Are there any tools to ensure that I am notified of specific sales?</h3>    <p>Steam\'s Wishlist feature can be used to receive a notification when a game that you want goes on sale.

The game input (keyboard, mouse or gamepad) is sent from the device you are using to the game process on the remote computer.</p>  <p>Any two computers connected to Steam can be used to stream a gameplay session and this can enable playing games on systems that would not traditionally be able to run those games. For example, a Windows only game could be streamed from a Windows PC to a Steam Machine running Linux in the living room. A graphically intensive game could be streamed from a beefy gaming rig in the office to your low powered laptop that you are using in bed. You could even start a game on one computer and move to a more comfortable location and continue playing it there.</p>  <p><a href="http://media.steampowered.com/apps/steamhardware/InHomeStreamingDiagram.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://media.steampowered.com/apps/steamhardware/InHomeStreamingDiagram_t.jpg" /></a></p>  <center><small>Overview of streaming from a PC to a Steam Machine</small></center>  <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="support"></a></p>  <h3>How can I tell if a game supports Remote Play?</h3>  <p>If a game supports Remote Play features, they will be listed on the game\'s respective Steam storepage. From the game details on the right side of the page, you can see which devices are supported, along with whether or not Remote Play Together is supported.</p>    <p><a name="howdoiuseit"></a></p>  <h3>How do I use Remote Play?</h3>  <p><b>Remote Play Anywhere</b></p>  <ol>  \t<li>Log in to the Steam client on the computer with the installed game you wish to play.</li>  \t<li>Now, Log into Steam on another computer or a supported device with <a href=\'https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about/\'>Steam Link app</a> installed.</li>  \t<li>From there, you can launch and play the game remotely from the Steam Library.</li>  </ol>  <p><b>Remote Play Together</b></p>  <ol>  \t<li>Launch your game.</li>  \t<li>Make sure your friend is logged in to Steam from a supported device.</li>  \t<li>Open your Steam Overlay in-game (shift+tab).</li>   \t<li>From your friends list, select \'Remote Play Together\'.</li>  \t<li>Once your friend accepts the invite, they will be in-game with you.</li>  </ol>  <p><a name="improvement"></a></p>    <h3>How do I improve my streaming experience?</h3>  <p>Hardware:<br/>  We recommend a minimum of a quad-core CPU for the computer running the game. The client has more modest requirements, but should have a GPU that supports hardware accelerated H264 decoding. Any recent laptop or PC should meet the client requirements.</p>  <p>Network:<br/>  We recommend using a wired network for the best streaming experience. People have had some success with powerline networks and wireless N and AC networks with good signal, though your experience may vary.</p>  <p>Game Settings:<br/>  To improve your streaming experience, you can go into your game settings and lower your resolution and turn off vertical sync.</p>  <p>Steam Settings:<br/>  In the Remote Play settings you can change a number of things that can affect your experience. You can change your preference for speed vs quality, limit the network bandwidth, and adjust the maximum capture resolution.</p>    <p><a name="communitygroup"></a></p>  <h3>Is there a community group?</h3>  <p>Yes, you can join the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream">Steam Remote Play</a> community group and discuss the feature with thousands of other players.</p>    <p><a name="basic"></a></p>  <h4>Issues & Troubleshooting</h4>  <p>Steam remote play is designed to require minimal setup, provided the game you are trying to play is already launching correctly on the primary PC. If you are experiencing a problem, try resolving it by following the troubleshooting info in this article. If you continue to experience the problem, or are encountering an issue that isn\'t covered here, you can always reach out and submit a detailed report to <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamLinkApp">Steam Support</a>.</p>  <ul>  \t<li><a href="#knownissues">Known issues</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#networkports">What network ports does streaming use?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#broadcastfailed">The computers don\'t see each other</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#updatedrivers">I haven\'t updated video drivers</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#dpiaware">Steam looks really small on the host after streaming</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#quiterror2">I get &quot;The streaming client exited unexpectedly (2)&quot;</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#nvidialaptop">Steam crashes or black screen when hosting from an NVIDIA laptop</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#blackscreen">I see a black screen when streaming a game</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#intelhardwareencoding">How do I enable Intel hardware encoding?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#nvidiahardwareencoding">How do I enable NVIDIA hardware encoding?</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#nvidiadeblockingsoftware">I see persistent smearing on the screen with NVIDIA hardware encoding</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#nvidiadeblockingmacosx">I see big blocky color areas with NVIDIA hardware encoding</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#muteaudio">I don\'t hear any audio when streaming a game</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#nocontrollerinput">My game controller input doesn\'t affect the game</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#nomousekeyboardinput">My mouse and keyboard input don\'t affect the game</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#invisiblemouse">My mouse cursor is invisible on Windows 8 and Windows 10</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#advancedtroubleshooting">How do I diagnose streaming performance problems?</a></li>  </ul>    <h3>Basic Troubleshooting</h3>  <p>Before you get too far down the troubleshooting path, it\'s a good idea to complete the entire setup process to ensure you are ready to use Remote Play.</p>  <ol>  <li>First, you\'ll want to Steam is up to date on both PCs. If you are using the Steam Link app, follow the appropriate setup guide <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8082-YJBN-9141">here</a>.</li>  <li>Now, from the machine that will be hosting the Remote Play session, you\'ll want to launch the game at least once to ensure it\'s up to date and working correctly.</li>  <li>If you are using Remote Play Anywhere, make sure you are logged in to the same Steam account on the remote device. From that Library, you should see the game listed as installed, with the option to \'Stream\' instead of \'Play\'</li>  <li>If you are using Remote Play Together, your friend should see that you are in-game in their friends list. You should see them as online.</li>  <li>If the game supports Remote Play Together, you can open the overlay in-game (shift+tab) and invite your friend from the friends list.</li>  </ol>    <p>If remote play still isn\'t working correctly, you\'ll want to have a look at the common issues below for more information. If that fails, you can always reach out and submit a ticket to <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamLinkApp">Steam Support</a>. We ask that you provide a deatiled report including the exact steps that you take to reproduce the behavior, so that we can isolate the issue and better provide a solution.</p>    <p><a name="knownissues"></a></p>  <h3>Known issues</h3>  <p>General:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>There is currently no indication of whether Steam is able to bind the discovery port 27036, but if that fails no other computers will show up in the remote computer list in the Remote Play settings.</li>  \t<li>If a game takes a long time to launch, it will time out on the client but will start anyway. Retrying the launch will connect to the running game. If this happens consistently for any particular game, please report it on the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/1">bug discussion group</a>.</li>  \t<li>If your game loses focus, Steam will start streaming the desktop so that you can get back to it. This is a feature of Steam Remote Play.</li>  \t<li>Streaming non-Steam games in the Steam library may work but is not officially supported.</li>  \t<li>Surround sound is not currently supported and is converted to stereo.</li>  \t<li>Voice recording over streaming is not currently supported.</li>  \t<li>Streaming may not perform well when streaming to older systems with a single or dual core CPU and no hardware accelerated H264 decoding.</li>  \t<li>DirectInput controllers other than gamepad style controllers (wheels, flight controllers, etc.) are not currently supported. Other controllers using XInput are fully supported.</li>  \t<li>Certain games like &quot;Rome: Total War&quot; use older DirectX technology which is not currently supported.</li>  </ul>  <p>Windows:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>Streaming from a Windows XP host is not supported.</li>  \t<li>UAC dialogs prevent streaming. If you\'re a game developer, please avoid requiring elevated permissions to run your game.</li>  </ul>  <p>Mac OS X:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>Streaming from a Mac OS X host is supported on Mac OS X 10.8 and newer.</li>  </ul>  <p>SteamOS / Linux:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>In order to support streaming game controllers on a Linux host computer, /dev/uinput or /dev/input/uinput needs to be readable and writable by Steam.</li>  \t<li>Currently, there is no rumble support for Linux machines.</li>  </ul>    <p><a name="networkports"></a></p>  <h3>What network ports does remote play use?</h3>  <p>Streaming uses UDP ports 27031 and 27036 and TCP ports 27036 and 27037. Please make sure Steam can listen on these ports in your firewall software.</p>    <p><a name="broadcastfailed"></a></p>  <h3>The computers don\'t see each other</h3>  <p>Make sure they are on the same subnet and no other program is using UDP port 27036, which is used for the initial discovery protocol. If another program has bound this port, please report which program it is on the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/1">bug discussion group</a>.</p>  <p>If you\'re running a Mac client, try rebooting after Steam is updated.</p>  <p>Some people have also reported that custom firewalls or software like Hamachi interferes with the discovery process.</p>    <p><a name="updatedrivers"></a></p>  <h3>I haven\'t updated video drivers</h3>  <p>A number of bugs have been fixed in the latest video driver releases that may affect streaming. If you are getting poor performance, graphical glitches or black screens please make sure you have the latest drivers installed from your video card vendor\'s website.</p>    <p><a name="dpiaware"></a></p>  <h3>Steam looks really small on the host after streaming</h3>  <p>Exit Steam, right click Steam.exe and bring up the compatibility properties, uncheck &quot;Disable display scaling on high DPI settings&quot;, save the changes and restart Steam.</p>    <p><a name="quiterror2"></a></p>  <h3>I get &quot;The streaming client exited unexpectedly (2)&quot;</h3>  <p>You can look in the streaming client log to get more details about what happened.

To do this:</p>  <ol>  <li>Open Steam and navigate to your LIBRARY.</li>  <li>Right click on CS:GO and select ‘Manage’ > ‘Browse Local Files’.</li>  <li>Browse to the following folders and delete all content inside:   <ul>     <li>\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\csgo\\materials</li>     <li>\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\csgo\\models</li>  </ul>  </li>  <li>Once these folders are empty, <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335">verify your game files</a>. This will reacquire the game’s default files in these folders.</li>  </ol>  <p>Now that you have replaced any modified files with default files, re-test the issue.</p>  &nbsp;  </div>    <div class="section" id="reinstall">  <h3>Reinstall the game</h3>  <p>If removing third party files did not solve your vpk issues, try completely uninstalling CS:GO from your computer and re-downloading the game.</p>  <p>To uninstall, right click on CS:GO in your Steam Library and select ‘Manage’ > ‘Uninstall’, then re-download the game and re-test the issue.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="memory">  <h3>Replace faulting memory module(s)</h3>  <p>If you continue to experience .vpk errors this likely means that one or more of your computer\'s memory modules is bad or failing. You can test your memory with third party programs like Memtest, available <a href="https://www.memtest86.com/">here</a>.</p>  <p><b>Note:</b> Please ensure that you use Memtest version 4.2 or later, as earlier versions cannot test more than 4GB of memory.</p>  <p>If a memory module is bad or failing, we suggest that you contact the manufacturer\'s warranty department for an exchange or replace the faulting module.</p>  </div>',

            '<h3>Begin the installation process to cause Steam to recognize existing files</h3>  <p>Games may appear uninstalled when Steam no longer recognizes the installation files. As long as the game folders are still in the proper location, attempting to launch a game will prompt a download.

Aside from many potential performance issues, external hard drives may connect or disconnect from the computer at inopportune times as part of their normal operations. If you encounter this issue with an external drive, install Steam and your games to an internal drive instead.</p>  </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>To ensure that you do not encounter this issue, always allow Steam to close properly when shutting down your computer. Allowing Windows to force Steam to close when it is writing to a hard drive may cause Steam library and installation information to become corrupted.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Additionally, third party applications can prevent Steam from writing essential information.

            '<h2><a name="general"></a>General</h2>  <h3>Can I create more than one Fantasy League?</h3>  <p>You can create one Fantasy League for each tournament ticket that you activate. However, after activating a ticket, you can join any number of Fantasy Leagues.</p>  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>  <h3>How many members can be in a Fantasy League?</h3>  <p>You can have up to six members in a Fantasy League. Each will have their own team.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>What if I have an odd number of friends who want to play?</h3>  <p>That\'s fine! One rotating team each week will get a Bye (basically a free win).</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>What if two Fantasy Teams have the same number of wins? Are they tied?</h3>  <p>Ties are broken by the total number of points scored in the season.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>When does a matchup end?</h3>  <p>Weekly matchups end on Sunday night at midnight in the time zone of the tournament. At that point, wins and losses are assigned for that week, and the next matchups begin.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h2><a name="players"></a>Players</h2>  <h3>Can a player be owned by more than one Fantasy Team?</h3>  <p>No, players are exclusively owned by a single team.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>What does a player being &quot;Core&quot; or &quot;Support&quot; mean?</h3>  <p>Each player has been assigned a role, based on the role they generally play in pro matches. Players that play mid, off-lane, or carry are grouped under &quot;Core&quot;. Players that take more of a support role are classified as &quot;Support&quot;.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Does player role affect scoring?</h3>  <p>No, all players are scored based on the same criteria.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>How are players scored?</h3>  <ul>      <li>0.3 points per kill</li>      <li>-0.3 points per death</li>      <li>0.15 points per assist</li>      <li>0.003 points per last hit</li>      <li>0.002 points per gold per minute</li>      <li>0.002 points per XP per minute</li>      <li>0.07 points per seconds of enemy stuns</li>      <li>0.0004 points per allied healing done</li>      <li>1 point per tower kill</li>      <li>1 point per Roshan kill</li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h2><a name="rosters"></a>Player Rosters</h2>  <h3>How many players can I have on my team?</h3>  <p>You can have 8 players on your team. These 8 slots are divided into types.</p>  <p>Active Roster:</p>  <ul>      <li>2 Core</li>      <li>2 Support</li>      <li>1 Any</li>  </ul>  <p>Bench:</p>  <ul>      <li>3 players of any type</li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>What players can I put in each slot type?</h3>  <p>Core and Support players can only go into &ldquo;Core&rdquo; and &ldquo;Support&rdquo; slots. &ldquo;Any&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bench&rdquo; slots can contain players of any role. Note that a player in a Bench slot will not score points for their team.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>How often can I adjust my roster?</h3>  <p>You can set your Active Roster for each individual day. Any day you don&rsquo;t adjust your Active Roster, the settings in place on the previous day will automatically carry over.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>When does a day\'s roster lock?</h3>  <p>A day&rsquo;s Active Roster becomes locked at midnight in the time zone where the tournament is located. So for a tournament taking place in Europe such as DreamLeague Season 1, the Active Rosters will lock at midnight CET. This lock time is displayed on the roster editing panel.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>What does it mean when a roster is locked?</h3>  <p>When a roster is locked, you won&rsquo;t be able to make any changes to it. This is to prevent roster changes happening while matches are being played.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>How can I see how Pro Players have done in the past?</h3>  <p>The Player tab in the Fantasy section in the Community tab lists all players and their average stats over the last 100 league matches (all leagues) that they&rsquo;ve played.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>What happens if I miss my Fantasy League\'s live draft?</h3>  <p>The draft system will automatically pick players for you.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Do players get more points if a best-of-three goes to a third game?</h3>  <p>No. In a best-of-three series, each player earns points only for their highest-scoring games.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h2><a name="trading"></a>Trading and Free Agents</h2>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Can I remove a player from my team?</h3>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Yes, you can request to drop a player and pick up another that no other Fantasy Team owns (a &ldquo;free agent&rdquo;). These requests are all processed nightly. If multiple Fantasy Teams all attempt to pick up the same Pro Player, priority is given to the Fantasy Team with the worst record.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Can I drop and pick up more than one player at a time?</h3>  <p>No, currently you can only have one outstanding drop/add request.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Can I trade players with another Fantasy Team?</h3>  <p>Trading players between Fantasy Teams is not yet supported.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h2><a name="scoring"></a>Scoring</h2>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Do all matches played by a player in my roster count towards my score?</h3>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Each Fantasy League is associated with a specific tournament, and only matches played as part of that tournament count towards player scores.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Do all Pro Players have the same scoring criteria?</h3>  <p>Yes, all Pro Players, regardless of role, are scored based on the same factors.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Do players in Bench slots earn points?</h3>  <p>No, players on your Bench do not earn points towards weekly or daily point totals.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Does it matter if players win or lose their matches?</h3>  <p>No, scoring is entirely based on the player&rsquo;s performance in certain categories (kills, gold per minute, healing, etc). Whether they win or lose their match is not scored, though players that win matches will tend to have better individual performances.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3>When are scores updated?</h3>  <p>Scores are updated after every match completes.</p>',

We allow multiple submissions in-case your primary item is rejected. You should submit the items in the order of your preference (the top item is your first choice to bundle, 2nd item is your second choice, etc.). Additionally, you will need to create two sets of images for your league. One set of images that advertise only the league and another set that advertise the league with the item(s).

The <a href="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/files/tournament_revenue_calculatornew.xlsx">tournament tool</a> includes two tabs, one for tournaments with prize pool contribution and one for tournaments without prize pool contribution. The following is a guide of how to setup a ticket and/or bundle:</p>    <p class="MsoNoSpacing">If you have a bundle with a ticket and a courier the total revenue share would be divided in half between the courier and ticket. Below is an example for a tournament bundle with 2 items: the ticket and the courier.

            '<p>Trading is a community feature that allows you to make deals with other players for various Steam and in-game items. As in the real world, players may attempt to deceive or cheat you out of items. We encourage players to review the trading recommendations below in order to enjoy a safe and fair trading experience.</p>    <h3>What is a Scam?</h3>  <p>A scam is when a player convinces someone to make a deal (trade, gift or market transaction) under false pretenses. Scams usually involve deception in order to convince a player that they are getting a good or fair deal when in fact they are not.</p>    <p>Please view our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9958-MJDG-3003">Steam Item Restoration Policy</a> for more information.</p>',
            "<h4>Trades to Never Accept</h4>  <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>Trades involving money</h3>    <p>The Steam trading interface does not support the transfer of money in any form. This includes Wallet credits, PayPal, gift cards or any other type of currency.</p>    <h3>Trades involving CD Keys</h3>    <p>Trading for CD Keys is not supported in the Steam Trading interface. CD Keys that are offered are often for a different game, fake, used or region restricted.</p>    <h3>Trading items/gifts for nothing in return</h3>    <p>You should complete any trades in a single trade. The trading interface supports an unlimited amount of items to be included with each trade so there is no reason to perform multiple trades. If you choose to trade an item without receiving anything in return, you will receive a confirmation dialog prior to completing the trade which lets you know the item you are sending is considered a gift.</p>    <h3>Trades offering Steam Wallet credit</h3>    <p>Steam Wallet credit cannot be traded, moved, gifted or automatically added to accounts by other players. Never accept trades that offer Steam Wallet funds.</p>    <h3>Do not lend or allow others to borrow items</h3>    <p>If you give another player an item, there is nothing to stop them from keeping it. In most cases, if a user wishes to borrow an item they will not return it. Do not lend items to other players.</p>    <h4>Things to Watch Out For</h4>  <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>Ensure that you are trading with the correct person</h3>    <p>Scammers often try to impersonate friends and trusted traders. Make sure to review the information in the trade offer to ensure you&rsquo;re trading with the correct person. It is your responsibility to verify who you are trading with.</p>    <p>Steam provides plenty of information within the trade offer, including how long you&rsquo;ve been friends, Steam level, how old the account is, and what groups they are moderators of.</p>    <h3>Trades involving purchasing an item in order to trade the item to another person</h3>    <p>A scammer may attempt to convince you that they will trade you an item if you purchase and trade them something that is for sale on the Steam Market. The scammer will have an excuse as to why they cannot buy it themselves, and they will often have a reason for not being able to trade for it directly (the seller of the item will not communicate with them). After the item is purchased, the scammer will unfriend you and even ban you from communicating with them. The person selling the item is working with the scammer and they just sold a cheap item for a significant amount of money.</p>    <h3>Do not trade items outside of the trade itself</h3>    <p>If another player requests that you do, they could be attempting to scam you. Always insist that all items be traded within a single offer.</p>    <h3>Avoid using middlemen</h3>    <p>Middlemen should not be needed if you are trading within the system. A middleman can scam you by impersonating another trader, working with a scammer or keeping any item that you give to them.</p>",

            '<p>Provided below are fixes to some common issues, but if you are unable to understand the instructions or resolve the issue on your own, you must contact the manufacturer of your computer or allow your local computer professional to diagnose the issue.</p>    <h4>Drivers and Firmware</h4>    <p><em>Main article: <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6416-EYDH-0477">Updating Drivers</a></em></p>    <p>If your drivers are not updated to the latest version, you may be encountering a bug that has since been fixed in the new version of the drivers. Please update ALL of your drivers to the latest version.</p>    <p>If you are using Mac OS X, please ensure that you have installed all of the available system updates. See Apple Support, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541">How to get software updates for your Mac</a>.</p>    <p>Also, the AMD FX &quot;Bulldozer&quot; series of CPUs contains an incompatibility that must be fixed with an update.</p>    <h4>Overheating</h4>    <p>Overheating is especially likely if you encounter performance issues (games or applications slowing down or stuttering) before the error occurs.</p>    <p>Please note that some laptops or compact desktops may not have sufficient cooling to run high-usage applications (such as games) for a sustained period, especially in a warm environment.</p>    <p>Please ensure that the computer has adequate ventilation:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Laptops should be placed on a hard surface. The air used to cool them is often pulled from under the laptop, so soft surfaces (like couches, beds, blankets, or pillows) can easily cause overheating.</li>  \t<li>Desktops should be placed with adequate (4+ inches/10+ cm) space around all sides, front, back, and the top to allow air flow.</li>  \t<li>Some users have opened their case and used a regular desk fan to improve ventilation, however you will need to be careful to prevent foreign objects from entering the computer.</li>  </ul>    <p>If your computer is more than a few months old, or if you have pets or an otherwise dusty environment, please check your computer for dust and hair. If you are not comfortable opening your computer to check and/or clean the heat sinks and fans, please bring it to your local computer professional for cleaning. When cleaning, use only compressed air without touching interior surfaces (do not vacuum or brush as this can destroy your computer).</p>    <h4>Data Errors (Hard Drive or RAM)</h4>    <p>Some of the tests involved may require advanced technical knowledge. If you cannot understand the instructions, please contact your computer manufacturer or allow your local computer professional to troubleshoot the issue.</p>    <p>The first step is to verify that your hard drive is in good health and that all bad sectors have been marked as such by the drive.</p>    <h5>Windows:</h5>    <ol>  \t<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>(My) Computer</strong></li>  \t<li>Locate the hard drive Steam is installed on. By default, this is <tt>C:</tt></li>  \t<li>Right-click this drive and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>  \t<li>Click the <strong>Tools</strong> tab.</li>  \t<li>In the <strong>Error-checking</strong> category, click <strong>Check now...</strong></li>  \t<li>In the dialog that appears, check &quot;Automatically fix file system errors&quot; and &quot;Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.&quot;</li>  \t<li>Click Start.  \t<ul>  \t\t<li>If you are scanning the <tt>C:</tt> drive, you will be asked to schedule the disk check the next time you start Windows. Accept, restart your computer, and allow the disk check to start&mdash;do not press any keys to skip the disk check.</li>  \t</ul>  \t</li>  \t<li>Allow the disk check to complete. This process may take up to several hours, depending on the size of your hard drive and the number of errors.</li>  </ol>    <p>If errors are detected, you should also verify that your Windows system files are not corrupted. Please see the Microsoft Support article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833">Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</a> and follow the instructions to verify your system files.</p>    <h5>Mac OS:</h5>    <p>Follow the instructions provided in the Apple Support article <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201639">Using Disk Utility to verify or repair disks</a>.</p>    <p>If no errors are found or the issue continues, please ensure your RAM is functioning properly</p>    <h5>Windows &amp; Mac OS X:</h5>    <p>Use <a href="http://memtest.org/">Memtest86+</a> to test your memory. With Windows 7 or later, you can use the downloadable ISO image to create a CD or DVD without external software - simply right-click on the ISO file once it is downloaded and select &quot;Burn disc image.&quot; For further assistance with this tool, please visit the <a href="http://forum.canardpc.com/forums/73-Memtest86-Official-forum">Memtest86+ official forum</a>.</p>    <p>Errors indicate faulty RAM. You will need to isolate and replace the faulty module.</p>    <h4>Non-standard modifications</h4>    <p>Adjusting the configuration of your computer for more performance outside the manufacturer&#39;s specifications, including activities such as overclocking or core unlocking, can introduce instability. If you have made any such modifications, please set all configurations to their defaults and test the issue again.</p>  ',

The authenticator generates a code that you need to enter every time that you log on to your Steam account. The code changes every 30 seconds, can be used only once, and is unguessable.</p>    <p>This system (commonly called two-factor authentication) is stronger than just your username and a password.</p>    <p>Valve also strongly recommends that you add a phone number to your account, which makes recovering your account quite a bit easier, should you lose access.</p>    <p>Your phone does not need to be connected to the Internet for the authenticator to work (however, your phone does need to know the correct time).</p>    <h4 id="whyphone">Why should I add a phone number to my Steam account?</h4>    <p>Adding a phone to your account gives you more options to recover your account in case you forget your password, or if your account is stolen.

If your phone number is blocked because it\'s considered VOIP you will need to find a mobile or prepaid phone number to use on Steam.

You may use the same phone number on multiple accounts. You may enable Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator on multiple accounts on the same phone by logging in to each account within the app and following the procedure to enable the authenticator on each account. The app will provide codes for all accounts regardless of which account is currently logged in to the app. Accounts with the same phone number may be treated as the same identity with respect to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, policies, or restrictions.</p>    <h4 id="smscost"><a name="cost"></a>Do the SMS messages you send cost me anything?</h4>    <p>Standard messaging charges may apply; check your wireless phone plan to confirm.</p>    <h4 id="savedlogin"><a name="noprompt"></a> Why am I not prompted for a code when I save my login credentials in Steam?</h4>    <p>To make logging into your account faster, we do not require a code if you have saved your Steam client credentials. You may choose not to save your credentials and require a code on every login. You can change this in Steam\'s client settings under the account tab anytime by checking the box at the bottom that says, \'Don\'t save account credentials on this computer\'.</p>    <h4><a name="banbyphone"></a> Do VAC and Game bans apply to all accounts on a phone number?</h4>    <p>If an account that has a phone number registered to it receives a VAC or Game ban, all other accounts that use the same phone number will also receive a ban. If the other accounts do not own the game they will still receive the ban and be unable to purchase the title on that account.</p>    <p>This feature is not enabled for all games and will be used at the discretion of the developer.</p>',

            '<h1>Payment Disputes and Chargebacks</h1>    <p>When a cardholder or financial institution disputes a purchase made through Steam resulting in a payment reversal, this is considered a chargeback.</p>  <ul>      <li><a href="#7">Why do chargebacks result in account restrictions?</a></li>      <li><a href="#5">How can I remove the restrictions from my account?</a></li>      <li><a href="#6">What if the charges were unauthorized or made without my consent?</a></li>      <li><a href="#2">Why were games/items removed?</a></li>      <li><a href="#4">What if I disputed the purchase because of issues with the product?</a></li>      <li><a href="#8">What if I am unable to reverse the chargeback?</a></li>      <li><a href="#9">What if hardware is included in the disputed transaction?</a></li>  </ul>      <a name="7"></a></p>  <h4>Why do chargebacks result in account restrictions?</h4>  <p>Chargebacks typically occur when someone identifies unknown charges on their bank account, or finds purchases that were made without their consent.</p>  <p>In order to protect our users from additional unknown charges, accounts associated with chargebacks are restricted while disputes are reviewed.</p>    <p><a name="5"></a></p>  <h4>How can I remove the restrictions from my account?</h4>  <p>The quickest way to remove the restrictions is for the purchaser to contact the financial institution associated with the disputed payments in order to close them; doing so will restore access to the disputed content, as well as removing the restrictions from the account.</p>  <p>Depending on the institution associated with the payments, it may take several weeks after closing a dispute for the content and account features to be restored.</p>    <p><a name="6"></a></p>  <h4>What if charges were unauthorized or made without my consent?</h4>  <p>If the charges were made without your consent, please contact Steam Support in order to resolve the issue and safeguard the account from future unauthorized activity.</p>    <p><a name="2"></a></p>  <h4>Why were games/items removed?</h4>  <p>With any chargeback, funds are held from Steam or returned to the cardholder. Since the funds are removed, the product is temporarily locked.</p>  <p>If a dispute is closed and the funds are returned to Steam, the content associated with the dispute will be restored.</p>    <p><a name="4"></a></p>  <h4>What if I disputed the purchase because of issues with the product?</h4>  <p>We encourage users to work Steam Support for technical issues with products. Users may also need to contact the developer/publisher of the product for specific technical support.</p>  <p>If issues are unable to be resolved through support, users are encouraged to submit a <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/">refund request</a> through Steam.</p>    <p><a name="8"></a></p>  <h4>What if I am unable to reverse the chargeback?</h4>  <p>If a chargeback cannot be reversed by working with the financial institution associated with it, please contact Steam support for further assistance.</p>    <p><a name="9"></a></p>  <h4>What if hardware is included in the disputed transaction?</h4>  <p>Hardware chargebacks are similar to regular chargebacks in that your account will automatically be locked and restricted from future purchases.</p>   <p>Like regular chargebacks, you can remove the lock on your account by removing the dispute with your financial institution. Unlike other chargebacks, however, accounts locked for Hardware chargebacks will not be unlocked until the associated hardware is returned.</p>  <p>If you have disputed a hardware purchase please contact <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/">Steam Support</a> to resolve your issue.</p>        <script type="text/javascript">  \t  \t\tvar headerImage = $("<img/>", {  \t\t\tsrc: "https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_universe/Hardware_SteamLogo_Banner.png",  \t\t\tcss: {height: "320px", width: "100%"},  \t\t});    \t\t$(".container").css({"background": "url(https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_universe/bg.jpg) 0px 0px / 100% 6000px no-repeat", "width": "950px", "display": "inline-block"});  \t\t$("#contain_nav_search").after(headerImage);    \t\t// hack for hiding deskpro p tag around style  \t\t$(".steam-rma-css").parent("p").css("display", "none")    \t\t$("document").ready( function () {  \t\t\t$("#question").hide();      \t\t\t$(".troubleshooting_header_container").click(function (event) {  \t\t\t\tevent.preventDefault();  \t\t\t\treturn debounce(dropDownCollapse(this), 400 );  \t\t\t});    \t\t\tfunction dropDownCollapse (targetEl) {  \t\t\t\tvar $container = $(targetEl).closest(".content-hover-section");  \t\t\t\t$container.toggleClass("active");  \t\t\t\t$container.find(".troubleshooting-collapse").toggleClass("collapse");  \t\t\t\t$container.find(".triangle-toggle").toggleClass("collapse-triangle");  \t\t\t}    \t\t\tfunction debounce(func, wait, immediate) {  \t\t\t\tvar timeout;  \t\t\t\treturn function() {  \t\t\t\t\tvar context = this, args = arguments;  \t\t\t\t\tvar later = function() {  \t\t\t\t\t\ttimeout = null;  \t\t\t\t\t\tif (!immediate) func.apply(context, args);  \t\t\t\t\t};  \t\t\t\t\tvar callNow = immediate && !timeout;  \t\t\t\t\tclearTimeout(timeout);  \t\t\t\t\ttimeout = setTimeout(later, wait);  \t\t\t\t\tif (callNow) func.apply(context, args);  \t\t\t\t};  \t\t\t};  \t\t  \t\t});  \t  </script>',

I3 or above CPUs are recommended for 1080p streaming</li>  </ul>    <p><a name="9"></a></p>    <h3>How do I test my system requirements for streaming videos on Steam?</h3>    <p>Before you purchase a streaming video on Steam, you should consider watching one of the free streaming videos already on Steam. That will help to determine if your system can successfully stream videos.</p>    <ol>  \t<li>Log in to the Steam Client</li>  \t<li>From the Steam Store, click in the Search Box.</li>  \t<li>Type in <i>Free To Play </i>and select <i>Free To Play - Free Movie</i> from the search results</li>  \t<li>On the Free To Play store page, find <i>Watch Free To Play (Streaming)</i>&nbsp;and click Watch</li>  \t<li>The streaming video will then begin playing back</li>  </ol>    <p><a name="14"></a></p>    <h3>How long do I have to watch a video rental on Steam?</h3>    <p>Steam Video rentals give&nbsp;you a certain number of days to begin watching the video and then a certain number of hours to finish watching the video. That information can be found in the following places:</p>    <ol>  \t<li>On the Steam Store within the rental package section, e.g. Watch this 48-hour rental any time in the next 30 days.</li>  \t<li>After renting a movie on Steam, the remaining time is shown in the Steam Library for the rented video.</li>  </ol>    <p>Note: After the rental time has expired, the video will remain in your Library for up to 48 hours but will not be playable without purchasing a new rental period.</p>    <p><a name="3"></a></p>    <h3>How do I select a specific bit rate for streaming?</h3>    <p>The video quality will automatically adjust based on your available download bandwidth and current video resolution. However, if you wish to select a specific bit rate:</p>    <ol>  \t<li>Move your mouse over the video player</li>  \t<li>Click the settings icon <img alt="" src="https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/chat/icon_settings.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" /> on the right-hand side of the control bar</li>  \t<li>From the Quality drop down, select the target bit rate</li>  \t<li>The video will pause to buffer content at the selected resolution and then begin playing automatically</li>  </ol>    <p><a name="4"></a></p>    <h3>How do I enable closed captions?</h3>    <p>Not all streaming videos contain closed captions. If closed captions are available, they will be enabled automatically if the language of the audio does not match the language set in Steam.</p>    <p>To manually change the selected closed caption:</p>    <ol>  \t<li>Start playback of a Streaming Video</li>  \t<li>Move your mouse over the video player</li>  \t<li>Click the Caption Options (CC)&nbsp;on the right-hand side of the control bar</li>  \t<li>Select from the Captions drop down the language of captions you want displayed, or None to turn off captions.</li>  </ol>    <p><a name="5"></a></p>    <h3>How do I configure the display of closed captions?</h3>    <ol>  \t<li>Start playback of a Streaming Video</li>  \t<li>Move your mouse over the video player</li>  \t<li>Click the Caption Options (CC)&nbsp;on the right-hand side of the control bar</li>  \t<li>Set the desired closed captions display options</li>  \t<li>Click Done to accept the changes or click Cancel to undo all changes</li>  </ol>    <p><a name="18"></a></p>    <h3>How do I switch to an alternate video or audio track (e.g. commentary or language dub)?</h3>    <p>If a streaming video contains an alternate video or audio track such as a commentary or a language dub, you can switch between the available tracks using the Settings, Video / Audio Track selector.</p>    <ol>  \t<li>Move your mouse over the video player</li>  \t<li>Click the settings icon <img alt="" src="https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/chat/icon_settings.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" /> on the right-hand side of the control bar</li>  \t<li>Click the dropdown related to the video or audio track and select the track you want to switch to</li>  \t<li>Note: In Big Picture mode, the track will not change until you press A and close the Settings dialog</li>  </ol>    <p>The <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/245550">Free To Play (Streaming)</a> video contains an example of alternate audio tracks including an English Audio Track and two commentary tracks featuring Dota players, Fear and Dendi.</p>    <p><a name="19"></a></p>    <h3>How do I control a video using a game controller?</h3>    <p>A game controller (Steam Controller, Xbox, etc.) can be used to control the video player only when in Big Picture mode. A specific user interface has been implemented to support this.</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Use the joystick or dpad to move between the controls shown on screen</li>  \t<li>Use the A button to execute a control (Play/Pause, Stop, Skip Back/Forward, etc.)</li>  \t<li>Use the B button to navigate back or hide the controls</li>  \t<li>Use the trigger, shoulder and grip buttons where applicable to skip forward and backward through the video at different time intervals, from 15 seconds to 5 minutes</li>  \t<li>Use the Start button to Pause the video</li>  \t<li>Use the Back button to Stop the video and return to Big Picture</li>  \t<li>To preview the video, navigate to the playback progress bar and use the left or right stick (or scrub the right pad on the Steam Controller) to change the preview thumbnail. Press the A button to seek to that point in time for video playback</li>  \t<li>Use the CC icon to select a caption or subtitle language and customize the look of the captions</li>  \t<li>Navigate to the Volume control to change the volume using up and down or press the A button to mute/unmute</li>  \t<li>Use the Settings icon to change video quality, audio tracks, playback speed and other options</li>  \t<li>When appropriate, a Next Video button will be shown to move to the next video in the Series, Season or Bonus Video content.</li>  </ul>    <p><a name="12"></a></p>    <h3>Why does the video look corrupted with random blocks appearing?</h3>    <p>On some system configurations the combination of video hardware, video drivers and Steam\'s hardware acceleration can cause large pixels or macro blocks to appear on screen during playback. For some users, turning off Hardware Video Decoding can resolve this issue:</p>    <ol>  \t<li>From the Steam Menu, select Settings</li>  \t<li>From the settings list, click Interface</li>  \t<li>Uncheck &quot;Enable hardware video decoding, if supported&quot;</li>  \t<li>Click OK and Restart Steam</li>  \t<li>Play the Streaming Video to test this change</li>  </ol>    <p><a name="15"></a></p>    <h3>What are the &quot;additional components&quot; required for playback?</h3>    <p>When the Steam Client starts up, a set of components required to playback DRM encrypted content is downloaded. If you receive a message indicating the additional components failed to download, you can attempt to download and install the components manually. This may be necessary if your ISP restricts access to certain domains or URLs.&nbsp;</p>    <p>If you have issues completing the steps below, please create a support ticket at <a href="https://help.steampowered.com">https://help.steampowered.com</a> and we\'ll be happy to assist you step by step.    <div style="color:red">Please visit this FAQ outside of the Steam Client before completing any of the following steps.<br/><br/>You can find this FAQ by visiting the Steam store page for the video you are attempting to watch and then clicking on the Streaming Videos on Steam FAQ link in the Streaming Video section.</div>  <br/>    <p><u><strong>Windows 7 and above</strong></u></p>    \t<ol>  \t<li>Quit Steam.

Click on it, then click Install. A small download will occur and the player will be installed. Alternatively, the first time you attempt to watch a 360 video, you will be prompted to install the 360 video player.</li>  </ol>  <p><a name="360_content"></a></p>  <h3>What\'s available to watch now?</h3>  <p>To get started, take a look at this page to see what\'s on offer today: <a target="_blank" href="http://store.steampowered.com/search/?tags=776177&category1=992">Steam 360 Videos</a></p>  <p>Once a 360 video has been added to your Steam Library, you’ll find it in Library / Videos. Look for videos that have a [360] suffix added to their name. 360 videos will also appear in a VR category in the Videos section of the library.</p>  <p><a name="360_sysreqs"></a></p>  <h3>What are the system requirements to play a Steam 360 Video?</h3>  <p>The minimum specifications for 360 video playback today are essentially the same as the minimum specs for your Virtual Reality HMD. Specifics are outlined on the store page for a video but in general are:</p>  <ul>    <li>OS: Windows 10, 64-Bit Only</li>    <li>Processor: Intel® i5-4590, AMD FX 8350 equivalent or better</li>    <li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li>    <li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce® GTX 970, AMD Radeon™ R9 290 equivalent or better</li>    <li>Network: Broadband Internet connection</li>    <li>Storage: 50 MB available space</li>  </ul>  <p>Please be aware that playing back a 4K x 4K stereo video requires at least a GTX 1070 or equivalent AMD graphics card. If your computer cannot maintain playback at full resolution, a lower resolution will be automatically selected. A future update to the Steam 360 Video platform will introduce stereo FOVAS (see <a href="#360_formats">360 Formats</a> below) which will reduce the required bandwidth and video card requirements. </p>  <p><a name="360_bandwidth"></a></p>  <h3>What are the bandwidth requirements to play a Steam 360 Video?</h3>  <p>While the CPU and GPU will be heavily utilized when playing back the 4K stereo videos, an equally important factor is a consistent high-speed network connection.</p>  <p>The Steam 360 video player will automatically switch to the highest resolution that can be sustained with your network connection along with CPU/GPU usage. When a video plays, the current quality level including resolution and the bandwidth required will be displayed in the application window. If you wish to manually override the quality level, use the up and down arrow keys to change the quality level, or press the A key to return to automatic mode.</p>  <p>For this beta, we are recommending a download bandwidth speed of at least 15Mbps. For 4K x 4K stereo playback, a download bandwidth of at least 25Mbps is recommended. At lower download speeds, the videos will play but the quality will be diminished. </p>  <p><a name="360_controls"></a></p>  <h3>How do I control the Steam 360 Video player?</h3>  <br>  <strong>HTC Vive Controllers</strong>  <ul>    <li>If you have an HTC Vive, the controller should appear while you are watching the video in the HMD.</li>    <li>Click up on the touch pad to pause or play the video.</li>    <li>Click left or right on the touch pad to skip forward and back.</li>    <li>Click down on the touch pad to stop the video. </li>    <li>The current play time and play state will be shown just above the first active controller in the HMD.</li>  <li>Pull the trigger and you\'ll be shown the current quality level. Then click up or down to change to a different quality level. Click right (the A in a circle) and the video will go back to Automatic quality mode. </li>  </ul>  <br><strong>Oculus Touch Controllers</strong>  <ul>    <li>If you have an Oculus Touch, the controller should appear while you are watching the video in the HMD.</li>    <li>Push up on either thumbstick to pause or play the video.</li>    <li>Push left or right on either thumbstick to skip forward and back.</li>    <li>Push down on either thumbstick to stop the video. </li>    <li>The current play time and play state will be shown just above the first active controller in the HMD.</li>    <li>Pull either trigger and you\'ll be shown the current quality level. Then push up or down to change to a different quality level. Push right and the video will go back to Automatic quality mode. </li>    </ul>  <br><strong>Gamepad / XInput Devices</strong>\t  <ul>    <li>If you have a gamepad, the video UI will show up in a fixed position (either the forward direction in the HMD or at the bottom of the desktop window) </li>    <li>Push up on either thumbstick to pause or play the video.</li>    <li>Push left or right on either thumbstick to skip forward and back.</li>    <li>Push down on either thumbstick to stop the video. </li>    <li>The current play time and play state will be shown just above the first active controller in the HMD.</li>    <li>Pull either the trigger and you\'ll be shown the current quality level. Then push up or down to change to a different quality level. Push right and the video will go back to Automatic quality mode. </li>    <li>Note: Gamepad input does not work if you are using an HTC Vive controller setup.</li>  </ul>  <br><strong>Keyboard</strong>  <ul>    <li>If you are using a keyboard, the video UI will show up in a fixed position (either the forward direction in the HMD or at the bottom of the desktop window) </li>    <li>Press the space bar on the keyboard to pause or play the video.</li>    <li>Press the left or right arrow keys to skip forward and back.</li>    <li>Press escape to quit the video.</li>    <li>Press up or down on the arrow keys to switch between the different quality modes.</li>    <li>Press A to switch back into automatic quality mode.</li>    </ul>  <br><strong>Mouse Mode</strong>  <ul>    <li>A mouse can be used when an HMD is not present and SteamVR is not installed. The 360 video will appear in a window on the desktop monitor. </li>    <li>Left-click and drag in the window to move the around the 360 video.</li>    <li>Right-click to show and hide the analytics and help information.</li>    <li>Keyboard input must be used for seeking or pausing the video at this time.<br>    </li>  </ul>  <br>  <p><a name="360_formats"></a></p>  <h3>    What do the 360 Formats on the store page mean?</h3>  <p>There are 4 variations of 360 videos currently supported on Steam. Depending upon how the content creator has configured the video, you will see a combination of 1 or 2 and, 3 or 4.</p>  <ol>    <li><strong>Mono</strong> - This means the video was captured from a single position in space (whether virtual or real space) and the result is both eyes in the VR HMD are shown the same image. While you can look around, there will be no sense of depth in the video during playback.</li>    <li><strong>Stereo</strong> – This means the video was captured from two positions in space (whether virtual or real space) and the result is each eye in the VR HMD sees a slightly different image. When combined, this provides depth and distance in a 360 video.</li>    <li><strong>Equirectangular</strong> – When you look at a map of the Earth on a wall, you’re often seeing an equirectangular projection. It’s flattened so you can see all of the Earth at once, but distorts the content toward the top and bottom. 360 videos use this technique to capture and playback a 360 view in a rectangular video frame. When the video is played back, the flattened video frame is wrapped around a sphere to restore the original 360 view.</li>    <li><strong>FOVAS (Field of View Adaptive Streaming)</strong> – When using FOVAS, the amount of network bandwidth needed is reduced by presenting only the content directly in front of the user’s eyes with the highest level of detail. The rest of the 360 view is lower quality. As the user moves their head around, a different area of detail is then loaded to maintain the lower bandwidth requirements. See this page for a more detailed explanation: https://pixvana.com/intro-to-field-of-view-adaptive-streaming-for-vr/</li>  </ol>  <p><a name="360_distribute"></a></p>    </div>',

            "<p>Playing games should be fun. In order to ensure the best possible online multiplayer experience, Valve allows developers to implement their own systems that detect and permanently ban any disruptive players, such as those using cheats.</p>  <p>Game developers inform Valve when a disruptive player has been detected in their game, and Valve applies the game ban to the account. The game developer is solely responsible for the decision to apply a game ban. Valve only enforces the game ban as instructed by the game developer.</p>  <p>For more information about a game ban in a specific game, please contact the developer of that game.</p>",

CS:GO also uses game bans in its Overwatch system. Game bans allow developers to utilize Valve&rsquo;s banning infrastructure rather than implement their own ban tracking system.</p>  <p>More recently, game bans were added to users&rsquo; Steam profile pages. This was done for two reasons. The first reason was to help banned users know why they cannot join a protected matchmaking server. Many users were confused when they received an error trying to connect to a matchmaking server and yet did not see any bans on their account. The second reason was to allow other users to see whether accounts they had suspected of cheating were, in fact, banned. It can be frustrating to play a game with a cheater, and it helps to know when such a user is removed from the matchmaking system.</p>  </div>  </div>  <div class="QuestionContainer">  <div class="Question">If a developer communicates a ban request to Valve, is the offending player banned from launching that game &ndash; or from using Steam entirely? And, for how long?</div>  <div class="Answer">  <p>The effects of the game ban are determined by the developer, and must be consistent with a VAC ban, such as being prevented from playing online with other players and/or trading items for that game. It cannot prevent the user from launching and playing the game offline. It cannot prevent the user from using Steam.</p>  <p>The duration of the game ban is determined by the developer. Only permanent game bans are displayed on the user&rsquo;s profile. Temporary game bans, or suspensions, are not displayed.</p>  </div>  </div>  <div class="QuestionContainer">  <div class="Question">Does this mean developers can take my games away from me?</div>  <div class="Answer">  <p>No. The developer can only impose restrictions consistent with VAC, such as preventing online play and/or prevent the trading of items for that game.</p>  </div>  </div>  <div class="QuestionContainer">  <div class="Question">Will Valve review developer requests for banning in any way?</div>  <div class="Answer">  <p>Developers must be approved to use this system, and Valve reserves the right to revoke access to the system if the developer abuses it.</p>  </div>  </div>  <div class="QuestionContainer">  <div class="Question">Does this apply to all my games? Are banned players only banned from a specific game, or is their account banned from Steam entirely?</div>  <div class="Answer">  <p>This only applies to games that have been approved for this feature by Valve, and a game ban only applies to that specific game.</p>  </div>  </div>  <div class="QuestionContainer">  <div class="Question">Does the system for &quot;permabanning&quot; only apply to online multiplayer games, or any type of game?</div>  <div class="Answer">  <p>The banning system only applies to multiplayer games. The new feature of displaying bans on Steam profiles therefore also only applies to multiplayer games.</p>  </div>  </div>  <div class="QuestionContainer">  <div class="Question">Do players have the ability to appeal bans?</div>  <div class="Answer">  <p>Players should contact the game developer if they wish to appeal a game ban, since the developer has the data describing why the ban occurred.</p>  </div>  </div>  ',

            "<p><a name=\"whyclosed\"></a></p>  <h1>How does a Steam Support ticket become closed?</h1>  <h4>Closed by User Choice</h4>  <p>When you access an open Steam Support ticket, you have the option to mark it as solved by closing it. It's suggested that you do not close a ticket yourself unless you're sure that the related problem is solved.</p>  <h4>Closed Due to Inactivity</h4>  <p>Support tickets will close automatically if they have been waiting for a user's input for 14 days. Tickets will not automatically close if they're waiting to be addressed by a Steam Support agent.</p>  <h4>Closed by a Steam Support Agent</h4>  <p>After addressing the problems that Steam Support can help you out with, an agent may close a ticket. This will typically only be done when the problems that are being presented are outside of Steam Support's scope. Unless your support ticket includes abusive content such as harassment, spam, extreme vulgarity, or threats, a Steam Support agent that will be closing a ticket will state so explicitly.</p>  <h4>Closed by a Malicious Individual</h4>  <p>A ticket can be considered to have been maliciously closed when someone other than the person submitting the ticket closes it. </p>  <p>If your support tickets are being closed without response from the Steam Support team, and you're not closing them yourself, it's likely that someone else is closing them - perhaps maliciously. In the very rare cases where this happens, it can usually be attributed to an account hijacker that is trying to make recovery difficult for the account owner. While this is a serious situation when it comes up, it's also usually a simple matter of securing your computer and email account before getting back in touch with Steam Support to recover your Steam account.</p>  <h4>Can a Closed Ticket Be Reopened?</h4>  <p>Closed tickets can't be reopened - if you closed your ticket mistakenly, please create a new ticket and include your closed ticket's Ticket Number (HT-####-####-####) in your message.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a name=\"malclosed\"></a></p>  <h1>What should I do if I think my tickets are being closed maliciously?<h1>  <h4>If the ticket was submitted directly from your Steam account:</h4>  <p>The only way to close a ticket that was submitted from a Steam account is with access to that same Steam account. This may be someone else who has you login credentials, or it could be through remote or physical access to a computer that you've saved your login credentials with.</p>  <h5>How to fix:</h5>  <p>Using Steam's <a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1266-OAFV-8478>Account Security Recommendations</a> as a guide, secure your computer by scanning it for malware. Once you're sure that your computer is not infected with malware, secure your Steam account by updating its password to one that you haven't used previously and don't use with any other accounts. Updating your password will also force anyone who is logged in on a different computer to log in again, effectively removing any hijacker's access to the account.</p>  <p>Resubmit your Steam Support ticket once your computer and accounts are secure.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <h4>If the ticket was submitted via email (account recovery tickets):</h4>  <p>To close a ticket submitted via email, the person closing the ticket needs access to it via the unique ticket access link that's sent to your email address when creating the ticket or whenever it is updated with a response from Steam Support.</p>  <h5>How to fix:</h5>  <p>First, it's important that you consider a ticket whose access link may have been viewed by a hijacker as insecure. If you think that a hijacker has been viewing your emails, you should close any tickets that you submitted prior to securing your computer and email account.</p>  <p>In addition to our normal <a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1266-OAFV-8478>Account Security Recommendations</a>, make sure that the hijacker did not set up any forwarding rules to automatically forward all support related emails to an email address of their own.</p>  <p>While it's probably not a good idea to abandon one of your email accounts to a hijacker, you may choose to create a new email account or use an alternate account to contact Steam Support while you take measures to secure your original account.</p>  <p>Once you're sure that your computer and email account are secure, submit a new ticket to the Steam Support team.</p>",

You\'ll need to go to your Steam Inventory to verify the individual cards qualify, and sell them from there.</p>    <p>You\'ll still have the option to list the cards on the Community Market, if you prefer to do so.</p>    <h4>How was the buyback amount determined?</h4>    <p>The buyback amount is the peak market value of the item from the 24 hour period before the update was released and the buyback was announced.</p>    <h4>How long is the buyback period?</h4>    <p>The buyback period is from Dec 21st, 2018 to Jan 4th, 2019. To participate, make sure you sell your qualifying cards to Artifact before Jan 4th, 2019 4PM PST.</p>      <h4>Will there be future card buybacks?</h4>    <p>This is a one-time buyback offer resulting from a change in the design philosophy behind Artifact. Future balance changes will not be accompanied by buyback offers.</p>      <p></p>  <p><a href="https://playartifact.com/news/1714081669510213123">Read the Artifact blog post</a></p>',

            '<div class="warning">  <p>Valve employees will <i>never</i> ask you to trade your items to them; this includes users who claim to work for Steam Support.</p>  &nbsp;    <p>Users claiming to be a Valve employee, accounts asking to verify your items, and users who send you a message which insist you need to trade your items to them for investigation or security reasons should immediately be <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3415-WAFH-6433#reportscammer"> reported for trade scams.</a></p>  </div>  &nbsp;  <div class="section" id="whatisascam">  <h3>What is a trade scam?</h3>  <p>A trade scam is when a Steam user convinces another user to make a deal (trade, gift or market transaction) under false pretenses. Scams usually involve deception in order to convince a user that they are getting a good or fair deal when in fact they are not.</p>  <p>For more information on scams please read below and view our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8912-WEYU-8454">Recommended Trading Practices</a> article and the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9958-MJDG-3003">Steam Item Restoration Policy</a>.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="bestways">  <h3>What are the best ways to avoid getting scammed?</h3>  <ul>  \t<li>You don\'t need to rush to complete a trade. If you recieve an offer, take your time to thouroughly review the contents. Once you confirm a trade offer, there is no going back.</li>  \t<li>Ignore pressure to trust the other user. If you are trading with a user who insists that you trust them, they are probably attempting to scam you. Please note that +rep comments can be generated easily by malicious groups.</li>  \t<li>Mouse over every item to ensure that the item/gift properties are correct. Information about the item/gift will be shown in the tooltip, including the quality, name, description and any effects.</li>  \t<li>Do not trade items in separate or future trades. If another user requests that you do multiple trades, they could be scamming. Always insist to complete the entire trade in one single offer.</li>  \t<li>Ensure that you are trading with the correct user. Scammers may try to impersonate your friends and other trusted traders. It is your responsibility to know who you are trading with.</li>  </ul>  </div>    <div class="section" id="whattrades">  <h3>What kind of trades should I avoid?</h3>  <p>Do <i>not</i> trade for anything that cannot be added into the Steam trading window. The most common examples of these types of trades include:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>Trading items/gifts for money outside of the Steam Community market. You cannot add Wallet credit, PayPal, gift cards or any form of money to trade offers.</li>  \t<li>Trading items/gifts for CD Keys. You cannot add a CD Key into the trade window. CD Keys that are offered can be for a different game, fake, used or region restricted.</li>  \t<li>Trading items/gifts for nothing in return in the first trade and expecting to get an item or gift in a later trade. There is no reason to not trade everything in one trade. You may add unlimited items/gifts to a single trade. A common example of this is using a middleman to facilitate a one-sided trade.</li>  </ul>  <p>For more information, please see our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6748-ETSG-5417">Steam Trading FAQ</a> and <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8912-WEYU-8454">Recommended Trading Practices</a> articles.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="whatscams">  <h3>What specific scams should I be aware of?</h3>  <div class="important">  <p>Users should always double check the contents of a proposed trade before accepting, even if that means inspecting each item in a multiple-item trade. Be sure to verify the item and its quality before confirming any trade.</p>  </div>  <p>There are a number of common scams users may attempt to deceive you out of your items:</p>  <ul>  <li><b>Item switching -</b> You discuss a trade offer with another user beforehand, and the item they put into the trade offer looks like the item, but isn\'t as valuable as the original offer.</li>  <li><b>CS:GO quality switch -</b> A user offers you a specific quality CS:GO item (Factory New), but the item in the offer is of a lower quality (Field-Tested). Often the item switch is made in a counter-offer.</li>  <li><b>Hidden item -</b> A user offers a trade that includes a lot of your low value items (cards, crates, etc.), but also includes a high value item hidden somewhere in the middle.</li>  <li><b>Begging/spamming -</b> A user spams trade offers requesting high value items for nothing or little in return in hopes that you mis-click and accept the offer.</li>  <li><b>Forward confirmation email -</b> A user convinces you to forward your confirmation email to their email address. They then confirm the trade using the link in the message. Do not forward trade confirmation emails or links and do not provide additional information to another user asking for information used for your account.</li>  <li><b>Money For Items -</b> A user offers to send you money in the form of PayPal, PaySafeCard, Steam Wallet codes, Steam Digital Gift Cards, etc. The scammer usually sends you a fake payment code after the trade is completed. In the case of Steam Digital Gift Cards, the scammer may even appear to pay you first, but be planning to charge the Digital Gift Card back later or buy the gift card with a fraudulent credit card.</li>  <li><b>CD keys for items -</b> A user offers to send you a Wallet Credit code or a game\'s CD Key in exchange for your items. The scammer usually sends you a fake CD Key after the trade is completed.</li>  <li><b>Users offering item duplication -</b> A user offers to duplicate your items, but first you have to trade away your items. After receiving your items, the user blocks your messages and keeps your items.</li>  <li><b>Users acting as trade bots -</b> A user impersonating a trade bot(s) tells you that you have to trade them some items. After you\'ve accepted the trade and sent the user the items, they block you on Steam and keep your items.</li>  <li><b>Middleman trades -</b> If you are performing a trade that sits within <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8912-WEYU-8454">Steam\'s trading guidelines</a>, there is no need for a middleman. Any time you choose to trust any other user with one of your items, you are allowing them the opportunity to scam you.</li>  <li><b>Verification accounts -</b> A user wants you to trade an item for "verification". The user will give a made-up excuse to convince you to do this, such as needing to make sure the item is not a duplicate or to ensure the item is not bugged. These users will then keep your item(s) and block you, getting away with the items.</li>  <li><b>Fund transfer via the Steam Market -</b> A user offers to send you Steam Wallet funds by buying one of your low value items at a high price in the market. Most of these offers are done using fraudulent funds.</li>  <li><b>Voice comm software/join our tournament team (malware) -</b> A user convinces you to install malware hidden in a voice communication, anti-cheat, or other type of software by claiming that they need you to install it so that you can play in a tournament.</li>  <li><b>Offering fraudulent items for resale -</b> Malicious users will sometimes acquire unusual items (often with fraudulent credit cards) and then attempt to trade them to you for more well known items with established value. Prior to doing this they may also manipulate the Steam Community Market price of these unusual items by using stolen credit cards. Watch out for claims that they will <i>overpay</i> or that you can <i>quicksell (qs)</i> the items for an immediate profit. Consider why the user would be willing to take a loss by trading the items to you instead of selling them themselves. As an excuse, these users will sometimes say they need <i>tradeable keys</i> or other tradeable items. Do not accept these trades as the value of the unusual items has been falsified and the subsequent Market transactions may be reversed due to fraudulent activity.</li>  </div>  &nbsp;  <div class="section" id="scamvshijack">  <h3>What is the difference between a scam and a hijack?</h3>  <p>A scam is when a user deceives another user into willingly (at the time) completing a trade, market transaction, or sending a gift. After the trade is completed, the person who was scammed either doesn\'t receive what was promised, or the items involved are not what was agreed upon.</p>  <p>A hijacking is when an account or a computer is taken over by someone else without the account owner\'s permission. This is often done with malware or a virus. In some cases the hijacker will convince a user to hand over their login information by providing a fake Steam or a third-party trading site. Hijackers most commonly steal accounts to gain items or games, and sometimes commit fraud. Hijackers often use stolen accounts to commit more hijackings. In these cases, we lock the account until the rightful owner contacts us about the hijacking.</p>  <p>Additional information about hijacked accounts can be found in our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2347-QDFN-4366">Reclaiming a Stolen Steam Account</a> article.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="reportscammer">  <h3>How do I report a scammer?</h3>  <p>If you\'ve been scammed or another user has attempted to scam you, please use the Report feature built into Steam. This is the best way to bring scammers to our attention so we may take action:</p>  <ul>  \t<li>Go to the profile of the offending user</li>  \t<li>Click the \'More\' drop-down located at the top right of the page</li>  \t<li>Choose \'Report Violation\'</li>  \t<li>Select the violation (example, \'Attempted Trade Scam\') and hit \'Submit Report\'</li>  </ul>  <p>If a user you\'ve reported for scamming has had action taken on their account, you\'ll be notified with a message in Steam.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="whathappens">  <h3>What action is taken when a scammer is found?</h3>  <p>If evidence exists that a Steam user is scamming, Steam Support will ban the account from using the Steam Community, including trading and using the Steam Market. The length of the ban is dependent on the severity and quantity of the scams. In some cases, scammers will be banned permanently. If a scammer has multiple accounts, all of their accounts may be subject to the ban as well.</p>  <p>In rare cases, scammers will hijack an account and use it to commit scams, fraud, or other hijackings. In these cases, we lock the account until the rightful owner contacts us and we will take appropriate action.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="noreturn">  <h3>Why doesn\'t Steam return scammed items?</h3>  <p>Our community assigns an item a value that is at least partially determined by that item\'s scarcity. If more copies of the item are added to the economy through inventory rollbacks, the value of every other instance of that item would be reduced.</p>  <p>We sympathize with people who fall victim to scams, but we provide enough information on our website and within our trading system to help users make good trading decisions. For more information on this, please see <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/20631/">this post</a> on our store blog.</p>  <p>Upon receiving a trade ban, the offending account also gets placed into trade probation as well. Probationary status allows other users to determine if a user has committed scams in the past so they can make better decisions about whether or not they want to trade with users who have scammed. Please note, probationary status does <i>not</i> prevent users from trading.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="whynoinfo">  <h3>Why won\'t Steam Support provide information on why an account was trade banned or locked?</h3>  <p>By limiting the provided data, Steam Support prevents malicious users from learning how to avoid getting caught in the future. Steam Support relies on several data points to arrive at a decision to ban or lock an account. Users intent on committing malicious activity, most often done to other users, are constantly trying to gain this data to use in future scams, fraud and hijackings.</p>',

Make sure that if you are reproducing a purchasing issue, you read the note at the bottom of this article and obscure your credit card information.</p>  <h3>Chrome:</h3>  <ol>      <li>Open the Chrome developer tool using the default shortcut (F12 on Windows, Ctrl + Shift + i on Linux, and Cmd + Opt + i on OS-X). Alternatively, the developer tool can be opened by navigating to the Chrome menu at the top-right of your browser window, then selecting Tools &gt; Developer Tools.</li>      <li>Select the Network tab at the top-left of the developer tool. From here, ensure that the red light is on, indicating that network traffic is being recorded.</li>      <li>Now, you will need to refresh the webpage and reproduce the steps that led to your issue. You should see a number of entries being created in the Network table.</li>      <li>Finally, right-click anywhere within the table and select \'Copy all as HAR\'. This will copy the contents of the log to your system clipboard, allowing you to paste the contents into a notepad .txt file, which can be submitted to Steam Support.</li>  </ol>  <h3>Internet Explorer:</h3>  <ol>      <li>Open the IE developer tool using the default shortcut (F12 on Windows, Ctrl + Shift + i on Linux, and Cmd + Opt + i on OS-X). Alternatively, the developer tool can be opened by selecting \'F12 Developer Tools\' from the Tools dropdown in the IE browser toolbar.</li>      <li>Select the Network tab at the top-left of the developer tool. There should be a green play icon in the developer toolbar, indicating that network traffic is not yet being recorded.</li>      <li>Now, you will need to refresh the webpage, press the green play icon, and reproduce the steps that led to your issue. You should see a number of entries being created in the Network table.</li>      <li>After stopping the recording by pressing the red stop icon, you will want to export the data as an .xml file by selecting the \'export capture traffic\' icon in the toolbar.

What does that mean and what can I do?</p>    <div class="important">  <h3>Important:</h3>    <p>Steam account ownership cannot be transferred.</p>    <p>Buying, selling, trading, or gifting a Steam account is a violation of the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/">Steam Subscriber Agreement (SSA)</a>.</p>  </div>',
            '<h4>What does it mean?</h4>    <p>An account is considered contested only if <b>both</b> of the following two requirements are met:</p>    <ol>  \t<li>Two or more different users are trying to claim ownership of the Steam account</li>  \t<li>Two or more of the users that are attempting to contest ownership are able to provide roughly equal levels of proof of ownership for that Steam account</li>  </ol>    <p>When two separate users are able to provide proof of ownership for an account, Steam Support must ask for escalated forms of proof of ownership to determine the rightful owner.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h4>What can I do?</h4>    <p>If someone is successfully contesting the ownership of an account that you own, you <b>must</b> secure the computer and&nbsp;email account that you are using to contact Steam Support.</p>    <p>If your computer and email account&nbsp;are not secure, you may unintentionally provide a malicious user with access to strong proof of ownership for your account, such as credit card or PayPal billing information as well as any proof of ownership that you already provided in another support ticket. This will make it very difficult for Steam Support to return the account to you.</p>    <p>Steam Support can usually restore an account to the contesting individual that provides the oldest form of proof of ownership for that account.</p>    <p>For more information about providing proof of ownership, check out the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2268-EAFZ-9762">Providing Proof of Ownership</a> article</p>    <p>Contested accounts take significant time to investigate, and Steam Support may request additional information from you to verify ownership.</p>    <ol>  \t<li><b>Secure your computer and email&nbsp;accounts</b></li>  \t<li><b>Provide the oldest proof of ownership for your account that you can</b></li>  \t<li><b>Wait for further instructions from Steam Support</b></li>  </ol>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h4>How can I prevent my account from becoming contested?</h4>    <p>The creator of a Steam account will be able to take the account back from you by contacting Steam Support. If an account is determined to have been sold by its owner, it will be restricted for violating the SSA once returned.</p>    <p>Granting another user access to your account is incredibly risky in addition to being a violation of the SSA. Even a trusted friend could attempt to take full control of your account.</p>    <p>If you wish to share your games, you can do so using the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3784-QLBM-5731">Steam Family Library Sharing feature</a>.</p>    <p>Do not share your account or password with anyone. This information is often crucial to malicious users who are attempting to steal your account.</p>    <p>A malicious user may be able to compromise some information that could make them appear to be the owner by accessing the email address attached to the Steam account. Such information is usually a weaker form of proof of ownership than the information that Steam Support will request from you, but could complicate matters during the investigation.</p>    <p>If a security lapse allows a malicious user to access the information that you\'ve submitted to Steam Support as proof of ownership in the past, your support technician will have difficulty determining the correct owner of the account.</p>    <p>CD Key marketplace websites and trade forums often contain scammers that will sell or trade keys and then attempt to use the key to claim ownership of your account. For your protection, it is recommended that you avoid such sites and forums. Follow the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8912-WEYU-8454">Recommended Trading Practices</a> for all trade interactions involving your Steam account.</p>    <p>Some traders offer to log in to your account to add funds to your wallet as part of a transaction. Even if they don\'t steal your account the instant that you provide them with access, they may attempt to claim it later through Steam Support. Additionally, Steam Support may request information about the transaction in a future interaction.</p>    <p>Avoid all transactions and trades in which another user offers Steam Wallet funds.</p>    <ul>  \t<li><b>Do not purchase Steam accounts from other users</b></li>  \t<li><b>Do not share your account</b></li>  \t<li><b>Keep your Steam account name and password confidential</b></li>  \t<li><b>Keep your Steam account\'s attached email account secure</b></li>  \t<li><b>Do not activate CD Keys from untrusted sources</b></li>  \t<li><b>Never accept wallet funds as part of a sale or trade</b></li>  </ul>',

Check Steam Overlay functionality</h5>  \t\t<p>The Steam Overlay is vital to Steam Controller functionality. Press the Steam button on your controller, or ALT+TAB on your keyboard to bring up the overlay. If the Steam Overlay doesn\'t appear, make sure you\'ve enabled it through the Steam settings menu.</p>  \t\t<ol>  \t\t\t<li>In the Steam client or Big Picture Mode, open the settings menu</li>  \t\t\t<li>Under the <font color="white">In-Game</font> tab, make sure the <font color="white">Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game</font> box is checked</li>  \t\t\t<li>Confirm by clicking <font color="white">OK</font></li>  \t\t</ol>  \t\t<br>    \t<h5>2. Launch the game from Steam</h5>  \t\t<p>Steam may have issues applying the Steam Overlay to non-Steam or retail games. Please try <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2219-YDJV-5557">adding retail or non-Steam games</a> to your Steam library. Once the game is added, launch the game from your Steam library</p>  \t\t<br>  \t\t\t\t  \t<h5>3.  Disable game launcher overlays</h5>  \t\t<p>Some games use a separate launcher outside of Steam (Uplay, Origin, Bethesda, Square-Enix, etc.). These games may have overlays that interfere with the Steam Overlay. To disable these overlays:</p>  \t\t<ol>  \t\t\t<li>Launch the game from Steam</li>  \t\t\t<li>Locate the external launcher settings menu</li>  \t\t\t<li>Select the option to disable the overlay</li>  \t\t</ol>  \t\t<br>    \t<h5>4. Change your controller configuration</h5>  \t\t<p>To create your own configuration:</p>    \t\t<ol>  \t\t\t<li>Open Steam in Big Picture Mode</li>  \t\t\t<li>Select game from your library and select <font color="white">Manage Game</font></li>  \t\t\t<li>Under <font color="white">Preferences</font> select <font color="white">Configure Controller</font></li>  \t\t\t<li>Customize your Steam Controller input settings for that game</li>  \t\t</ol>    \t\t<p>You can build from the <font color="white">Keyboard (WASD) Mouse</font> configuration for keyboard/mouse input, and <font color="white">Gamepad</font> listed under the Template section to avoid using hybridized input that some games may not accept.</p>  \t\t<p>Note: Rename the binding to be easily located. It is listed in your Templates section. Make any input modifications that you need and export/save the configuration.</p>    \t<br>    \t<h5>5. Disable input emulators and streaming software</h5>  \t\t<p>If you have an Xinput emulator (Joy2Key), any type of input management software (Razer Synapse, Logitech), screen capturing software (NVIDIA ShadowPlay), a framerate counter program, or others installed on your computer, it may conflict with the Steam Controller. Try disabling these programs and retest the issue.</p>    \t\t<p>Check out our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9828-SFLZ-9289">Programs Which May Interfere with Steam </a>FAQ.</p>    \t</div>  \t</div>  </div>      <div class="content-hover-section">  \t<div class="troubleshooting_step_container">  \t<div class="troubleshooting_header_container">  \t\t<h2 class="troubleshooting-header">How to use the Steam Controller with non-Steam games</h2>  \t\t<div class="triangle-toggle">&nbsp;</div>  </div>    <div class="troubleshooting-collapse collapse">  \t<p>You’ll need to add the game and/or launcher to your Steam Library:</p>  \t\t<ol>  \t\t\t<li>Launch Steam and click the <font color="white">Games</font> menu</li>  \t\t\t<li>Select <font color="white">Add a Non-Steam Game</font> to <font color="white">My Library</font></li>    \t\t\t<li>Find your game on your computer or check the box next to the game</li>    \t\t\t<li>Select <font color="white">Add Selected Programs</font></li>    \t\t</ol>    \t<p>Make sure to enable your Steam Overlay globally in the Steam client Settings:</p>  \t\t<ol>  \t\t\t<li>Select Steam in the top left of the menu bar, then select <font color="white">Settings</font></li>  \t\t\t<li>Go to the <font color="white">In-game</font> tab</li>    \t\t\t<li>Check the <font color="white">Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game</font> box</li>    \t\t\t<li>Optionally, check the Use Big Picture overlay when launching from desktop mode.</li>    \t\t</ol>    \t<p><em>If your third-party client has an Overlay, disable it to make sure it doesn’t conflict with the Steam Overlay.</em></p>    \t</div>  \t</div>  </div>      <div class="content-hover-section">  \t<div class="troubleshooting_step_container">  \t<div class="troubleshooting_header_container">  \t\t<h2 class="troubleshooting-header">Phantom input</h2>  \t<div class="triangle-toggle">&nbsp;</div>  </div>    <div class="troubleshooting-collapse collapse">  \t<p>If you\'re experiencing random input or drifting trackpads, you may need to calibrate your Steam Controller.</p>  \t\t<ol>  \t\t\t<li>While in Big Picture Mode, select the settings icon in the top-right corner of the client</li>  \t\t\t<li>Under <font color="white">Controller</font>, select <font color="white">Controller settings</font></li>  \t\t\t<li>Find your controller listed under <font color="white">Detected Controllers:</font></li>  \t\t\t<li>Select your controller and click <font color="white">CALIBRATE</font></li>  \t\t\t<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete calibration</li>  \t\t</ol>    \t<div align="center"><iframe width="500" height="280" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xMYm8eZskIc?&showinfo=0&rel=0&cc_load_policy=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>  \t<br>    \t</div>  \t</div>  </div>      <div class="content-hover-section">  \t<div class="troubleshooting_step_container">  \t<div class="troubleshooting_header_container">  \t\t<h2 class="troubleshooting-header">Problems using multiple controllers</h2>  \t<div class="triangle-toggle">&nbsp;</div>  </div>    <div class="troubleshooting-collapse collapse">  \t<p>The Steam Controller uses XInput to send commands to your computer.

            '<h3><a name="whatis"></a>What are trade and Market confirmations?</h3>    <p>Trade confirmations are the final step in the trade process where you verify trades before they are completed. Market confirmations are the same as trade confirmations, the final step in the process of listing an item on the Market that ensures your items cannot be listed or sold without your approval. If you&#39;re using a Mobile Authenticator through the Steam Mobile App on your smartphone, you&#39;ll receive confirmations via the app, otherwise you&#39;ll receive them by email.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3><a name="how"></a>How do confirmations work?</h3>    <p>When you send a trade offer, accept a trade, or create a Market listing you&#39;ll need to confirm that action through email or the mobile app before it will be sent or posted. If you don&#39;t confirm it, the trade will not be made (or the Market listing will not be posted.)</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3><a name="why"></a>Why are confirmations necessary?</h3>    <p>Confirmations give you better control over items moving in and out of your account. You have the opportunity to review the items in a trade or make sure you&#39;ve entered the right price for a Market listing before it is final. If your account or computer becomes compromised, confirmations make it very difficult for an attacker to steal your items.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3><a name="optout"></a>How do I opt out?</h3>    <p>To ensure that you are in control of items moving out of your account, trades and Market listings must be confirmed. There is no longer a way to opt out.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3><a name="notrecognized"></a>What do I do if I receive a confirmation request for a trade or listing I didn&#39;t create?</h3>    <p>Open the confirmation request and cancel the trade or listing. It&#39;s possible that your account or computer has been compromised. Use <a href="https://help.steampowered.com">https://help.steampowered.com</a> to change your Steam account password and consider changing your email account password as well. If you&#39;re unable to log in to Steam with your account credentials you should contact Steam Support to regain access.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3><a name="phone"></a>How do I get confirmation requests via phone?</h3>    <p>You can get confirmation requests through the Steam Mobile App on your smartphone if you&#39;re using it to protect your account. Set up the app to act as a Mobile Authenticator and you&#39;ll automatically receive confirmations in the app.</p>    <p>Here&#39;s where you can <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/mobile">download and learn more about the Steam Mobile App</a>.</p>  ',

See our <a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3629-RIAV-1617>In-Home Streaming FAQ</a> for more details on this technology.</p>  \t\t<p>If you haven\'t already, we also recommend checking out the <a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1456-EUDN-2493>Troubleshooting Network Connectivity</a> and <a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8861-QOHN-2234>How do I diagnose and report network problems?</a> articles for more background information and suggestions regarding general network troubleshooting.</p>  \t\t<p><em><font color=white>For specific information on how to accomplish these tasks, please see your modem/router&rsquo;s documentation.</font></em></p>    \x3c!--Root Cause--\x3e  \t\t<div align="center"; class="note"><h1>Troubleshooting First Steps</h1></div>  \t\t\t<h4>Connect your computer to a wired network</h4>  \t\t\t<p>One of the main causes of performance issues is interference. If your PC is on the wireless network and trying to send data to your router while your router is sending that data to your device or your device is talking back, they\'ll interfere and you\'ll have a choppy experience. We highly recommend making sure your computer is directly connected to the router with Ethernet.</p>  \t\t\t  \t\t\t<h4>Enable the Performance Overlay</h4>  \t\t\t\t<p>The In-Home Streaming Performance Overlay can help you determine if you are encountering a network-related problem. You can also use this feature to show the impact of the troubleshooting you perform.</p>  \t\t\t\t<p>Go into the advanced streaming settings on your device and enable the performance graph. Then, while streaming, watch for large spikes in the cyan line. This indicates highly variable network time, which is the main indicator of streaming network issues. These will usually coincide with video stuttering or freezing.</p>  \t\t\t\t<p>A detailed guide of the Performance Overlay and what the displayed information means can be found in the<a href=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/0/540732889636623310/#c540732889652053359> In-Home Streaming discussion forums.</a></p>  \t\t\t  \t\t\t<h4>Remove other sources of interference</h4>\t\t  \t\t\t\t<p>Other applications using the wireless network can interfere with game streaming. Make sure no one else is streaming movies or audio (using BitTorrent, Chromecast, etc.).</p>  \t\t\t\t  \x3c!--Can\'t Connect to PC --\x3e  \t<div align="center"; class="note"><h1>Can\'t Locate Your Computer?</h1></div>  \t  \t<h4>Network Ports</h4>  \t\t<p>In-Home Streaming uses the following ports:</p>  \t\t<ul>  \t\t\t<li>UDP ports 27031 and 27036</li>  \t\t\t<li>TCP ports 27036 and 27037</li>  \t\t</ul>  \t\t<p>Please ensure that Steam is allowed to listen to these ports in your host computer firewall software. We suggest contacting your network administrator or firewall software developer for more information.</p>  \t\t<p>See our <a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8571-GLVN-8711>Required Ports for Steam FAQ</a> and our <a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2198-AGHC-7226>Using Steam with a Firewall FAQ</a> for additional suggestions and more details on this process. Please note: If Steam or your game has updated recently, your firewall may be preventing network access even if it worked correctly before.</p>  \t\t\t  \t<h4>Client Isolation</h4>  \t\t<p>In order to use Steam In-Home Streaming, please <font color=white>ensure that Access Point/Client Isolation is disabled</font> in your router settings.</p>  \t\t<p>Please note: Steam In-Home Streaming is not supported on public networks, workplace or school/university networks, guest networks, networks with gateway portals or which require a log-in, or other networks with access point/client isolation enabled. These types of networks will prevent you from connecting in most cases. Please consult your network administrator for more details.</p>  \t  \t<h4>WPS</h4>  \t\t<p>The Steam Link is enabled to work with WPS security; however, if you encounter any issues connecting to a WPS access point, please disable WPS and use an alternative method of connecting to troubleshoot the issue.</p>    \x3c!--Poor Streaming Quality--\x3e\t\t  \t<div align="center"; class="note"><h1>Experiencing Poor Streaming Quality?</h1></div>\t\t  \t\t<h4>Connecting via a Wireless Router</h4>\t  \t\t\t<p>Steam In-Home Streaming is compatible with most home networks. A wired network will provide the best result, and we highly recommend using an Ethernet connection if your In-Home streaming client supports it. Wireless and power line connections can cause intermittent failures due to interference. You can test your devices using a direct wired connection to determine if this is a problem.</p>  \t\t\t<p>For best performance we recommend using a router that supports the 802.11AC protocol. <a href="http://shield.nvidia.com/routers">NVIDIA has created a list of recommended routers</a> that are also good choices for Steam In-Home Streaming. If the previous option is not available to you, a router that supports the 802.11N via a 5GHz signal will be the next best choice.</p>  \t\t\t<p>To optimize your network:</p>  \t\t\t\t<ul>  \t\t\t\t\t<li>Choose the 5 GHz WiFi band over the highly contested 2.4 GHz band. The 5 GHz band has a shorter range, but there is less interference from your neighbors and other wireless devices.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t<li>Choose a WiFi channel on the Access Point (AP) that isn\'t contested. A couple of smart phone and laptop programs are <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wifi_information_view.html">NirSoft\'s WiFi Scanner</a> or <a href="http://nutsaboutnets.com/netsurveyor-wifi-scanner/">NetSurveyor</a>. You lose over 50% of your data rate when there is channel interference with your neighbors.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t<li>Set the AP to use a 5GHz channel near the top of the band; the top end starts at channel 149.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t<li>Try to see if you can connect when the AP channel width is set to at 40 MHz, over a 20 MHz width for 11n and 11ac. If 40 MHz works, then try 80 MHz that is enabled with an 11ac capable router. Higher channel bandwidths can provide faster speeds but are more sensitive to distance and other sources of RF noise.</li>  \t\t\t\t</ul>  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t<h4>Move your equipment for a better signal</h4>  \t\t\t<p>The strength of the wireless signal is affected by interference from other wireless networks, distance, and walls, floors, metal, and electronic equipment between your wireless router and the Steam Link. Sometimes moving your router to a better location or moving your Steam Link out in front of your TV can help dramatically. Also make sure that your PC and router are in open, well-ventilated areas, as their performance will be reduced when they are overheating.</p>  \t\t\t  \t\t<h4>Change the Link’s streaming quality</h4>\t  \t\t\t<p>Setting the quality to “Balanced” or “Fast” will reduce the bandwidth used for streaming, reducing the visual quality and lowering the load on your network.</p>\t\t  \t  \t\t<h4>Device Priority/Quality of Service (QOS)</h4>  \t\t\t<p>Adjusting the designated bandwidth or device priority for your streaming client and host can improve the quality of your streaming experience. </p>  \t\t\t<p>Most routers include this feature as <font color=white>Quality of Service (QoS)</font> settings or <font color=white>Bandwidth Priority</font> settings that can be accessed through the router administration panel, or in some cases an associated application provided by your equipment manufacturer. Make sure that your streaming client and host are prioritized in these settings.</p>  \t\t\t<p>You can also enable network prioritization within Steam In-Home Streaming settings. Go to <font color=white>Steam > Settings > In-Home Streaming > Advanced Host Options</font>, and check the <font color=white>Prioritize Network Traffic</font> option at the bottom.</p>  \t\t\t  \t\t<h4>Update your router firmware</h4>  \t\t\t<p>Some wireless routers have bugs in handling the amount of UDP traffic sent in In-Home Streaming. Please make sure your router has the latest firmware updates to resolve any known issues.</p>  \t\t  \t\t<h4>Tune your streaming bandwidth</h4>  \t\t\t<p>You can directly limit the resolution and amount of bandwidth used in the advanced streaming settings. If you want to tune things exactly right for your setup, you can start at 3 Mbit/s and slowly increase the bandwidth until you start getting hitches and then drop it back down. You can do this live while your game is running by bringing up the Steam overlay with the guide button or Shift+Tab and going to the streaming settings panel.</p>    <div align="center">  <br><hr><br>  \t<h1>Support Resources</h1>  \t<div class="row">  \t    \t\t<div class="column">  \t\t  \t<a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=108>  \t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_faq.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t\t    <p><font color=white>View other FAQs</font></p>  \t\t  \t</a>  \t\t </div>  \t    \t <div class="column">  \t  \t<a href=http://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions>  \t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_developer.png" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t    <p><font color=white>Visit the community Forums</font></p>  \t\t</a>  \t </div>  \t    \t  <div class="column">  \t\t<a href=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGameIssue/?appid=353380&issueid=354&nodeid=1&return_nodeid=9>\t    \t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_steam.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t    <p><font color=white>Contact Steam Support</font></p>  \t\t</a>\t  \t  </div>  </div>    <p>  <style class="link-streaming-css" type="text/css">html {  \t\tbox-sizing: border-box;  \t}  \t  \tp {  \t\tfont-size: 14px;  \t\tline-height: 24px;  \t}    \tp span {  \t\tcolor: #fff;  \t}    \tul > li {  \t\tpadding: 0;  \t}    \t.right_col {  \t\tdisplay: none;  \t}    \t.left_col {  \t\twidth: 100%;  \t}    \t#content {  \t\tfont-family: "Motiva Sans Light", "Motiva Sans", Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif  \t}    \t#content .pagetext {  \t\tpadding: 13px 13px 0;  \t\tbackground: none;  \t}    \t#question {  \t\tborder-top: none;  \t\tmargin-bottom: 0px;  \t\tnone repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  \t}    \t#question > h1:first-child {  \t\tdisplay: none;  \t}    \t.page-title {  \t\tfont-size: 1.7em;  \t\tfont-weight: normal;  \t\tmargin: 0 0 10px;  \t\tpadding: 0;  \t\tfont-family: "Motiva Sans", Arial, sans-serif;  \t}    \t.content-section,  \t.content-hover-section {  \t\tbackground: none repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  \t\tmargin-bottom: 10px;  \t}    \t.content-section {  \t\tpadding: 13px;  \t}    \t.content-hover-section {  \t\toverflow: auto;  \t}    \t.content-hover-section:hover {  \t\tbackground: #015B8F;  \t}    \t.active {  \t\tbackground: #015B8F;  \t\tcolor: #fff;  \t}    \t.content-section img {  \t\ttext-align: center;  \t}    \t#question .content-section {  \t\tmargin-bottom: 0;  \t}    \t.left_col .pagetext .notice-text {  \t\tfont-size: 18px;  \t\tpadding-top: 20px;  \t}  \t  \t.list-bottom-border {  \t\tmargin: 18px 0;  \t}    \t.larger-list-text {  \t\tfont-size: 16px;  \t\tdisplay: block;  \t\tmargin-top: 5px;  \t\tmargin-bottom: 0;  \t\tlist-style: none;  \t}    \t.larger-list-text li {  \t\tcolor: #67c1f5;  \t}    \t.active {  \t\tbackground: #015B8F;  \t\tcolor: #fff;  \t}    \t.content-section img {  \t\ttext-align: center;  \t}    \t#content .contact_steam_support a,  \t#content .visit_steam_discussions a {  \t\tcolor: #fff;  \t}    \t.sublist {  \t\tmargin-top: 8px;  \t}\t  \t  \t* {      box-sizing: border-box;  \t}    \t.row:after {  \t    content: "";  \t    display: table;  \t    clear: both;  \t}\t  \t  \tul {    \t\tpadding-left: 10px;  \t}  \t  \tol {    \t\tpadding-left: 10px;  \t}    \t.column {  \t    float: left;  \t\t width: 33.33%;  \t    padding: 10px;  \t}    \t.left {  \t  width: 25%;  \t}    \t.right {  \t  width: 75%;  \t}    \t.row:after {  \t    content: "";  \t    display: table;  \t    clear: both;  \t}  </style>  </p>    <script type="text/javascript">  \t  \t\tvar headerImage = $("<img/>", {  \t\t\tsrc: "https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_link/SteamLink_Support_Header01.png",  \t\t\tcss: {height: "320px", width: "100%"},  \t\t});    \t\t$(".container").css({"background": "url(https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_universe/bg.jpg) 0px 0px / 100% 6000px no-repeat", "width": "950px", "display": "inline-block"});  \t\t$("#contain_nav_search").after(headerImage);    \t\t  </script>',

Your games will not play any better than they already do on your computer.</p>    \t<h4>How do I use the Steam Controller with the app?</h4>  \t\t<p>Make sure the Steam Controller is paired to the wireless receiver before attempting to use the controller with the Link application using the instructions below:</p>  \t\t<ol>  \t\t\t<li>Turn your Steam Controller off and launch Big Picture Mode with your mouse and keyboard.</li>  \t\t\t<li>Plug the wireless receiver into your host computer.</li>  \t\t\t<li>While in Big Picture Mode, select the ‘Settings’ icon from the top right section of the client.</li>  \t\t\t<li>From here, select the ‘Controller’ menu.</li>  \t\t\t<li>Then select \'Add Steam Controller’ and follow the on-screen pairing instructions</li>  \t\t\t<li>Once paired, plug the wireless receiver into the Samsung TV to navigate the Steam Link application.</li>  \t\t</ol>    \t<h4>Does the Steam Link app support connecting to a PIN secured host computer?</h4>  \t\t<p>No, in order to connect you\'ll need to remove the PIN by clicking on "Set Steam Link PIN Code" on the In-Home Streaming settings on the remote computer, leaving the PIN blank, and clicking OK.</p>  </div>\t    <div class="button-section" id="button2-section">  \t<div align="center" class="note">  \t\t<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>  \t</div>\t    \t<h4>Can\'t Connect to Network or Find Host Computer</h4>  \t\t<p>If you are experiencing issues connecting to or finding your host computer, try the following steps:</p>  \t\t<ul>  \t\t\t<li>Make sure the TV has the most recent firmware update.</li>  \t\t\t<li>Reinstall the Link application with the most recent version.</li>  \t\t\t<li>Power cycle the TV by unplugging it for 10 seconds.</li>  \t\t\t<li>Make sure the TV and the host computer are on the same network and client isolation is turned off on your router.</li>  \t\t</ul>    \t<h4>Contacting Samsung Support</h4>  \t\t<p>If you have issues with the app before streaming starts or questions about supported devices, please contact <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/contact/">Samsung Support</a>.

            '<div class="button-section" id="button3-section">  \t<div align="center" class="note">  \t\t<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>  \t</div>    \t\t<h4>Does the Touch Controller support Steam Input configurations?</h4>  \t\t\t<p>Yes, it does! You can bind controls, create action sets, use touchpad areas and your device\'s gyro, and publish configurations just like you would for any other controller. We will also work with developers to create touch layouts for their games and add other advanced features in the future.</p>  \t\t  \t\t<h4>I set up my Touch Controller, but it won’t stop moving the controls around on screen. What’s going on?</h4>  \t\t\t<p>It sounds like you have not yet finalized your layout. If you are still moving the controls, click the <font color="white">[ ... ]</font> button, and select ‘Done’. This will finalize your layout so that you can use it. </p>  \t\t\t  \t\t<h4>I\'m having difficulty pressing multiple face (A, B, X, or Y) buttons</h4>  \t\t\t<p>If you need to be hitting multiple face buttons at the same time in a game (for example, jumping while shooting in a platformer), you can bind your Right Thumb stick as a Button Pad in the Big Picture Controller Configuration. This will enable overlap for the face buttons, which will allow you to press multiple buttons simultaneously.</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t<h4>My phone vibrates when I play. Can I turn this off?</h4>  \t\t\t<p>Sure! You can modify these settings either in game, or through the Big Picture Controller Settings menu.</p>   \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t<h4>Some of the controls are grayed out in the layout tray. How do I fix that?</h4>  \t\t\t<p>Only the controls which are bound are available. For instance, if there are no macros bound, the macro buttons (M1 through M8) will be grayed out. You can change bindings and add new ones using the standard Steam Big Picture controller configuration UI.</p>  \t\t\t  \t\t<h4>Why do my touch controls keep disappearing?</h4>  \t\t\t<p>The controls vanish after a few seconds of being idle. They will reappear when you touch the screen again.</p>  </div>\t    <div class="button-section" id="button1-section">  \t<div align="center" class="note">  \t\t<h1>Touch Control Modes</h1>  \t</div>\t  \t\t  \t\t<p>The touch controller can emulate mouse functionality in three different ways:</p>  \t\t\t<ul>  \t\t\t\t<li><font color="white">Trackpad</font> - The screen acts as a trackpad where moving your finger pushes the cursor, tapping with 1 finger is a left click, tap and hold and then move for left click drag, tapping with 2 fingers is a right click, and tapping with 3 fingers toggles the on-screen keyboard. You can also move with one finger and then tap with another finger while moving to quickly left click and drag (e.g. 2 thumb mode). You can use pinch and zoom to zoom in on hard to read areas of the screen.</li>  \t\t\t\t<li><font color="white">Trackpad Cursor</font> - This works like the trackpad mode, but if you are zoomed in the view will be centered around the cursor.</li>  \t\t\t\t<li><font color="white">Direct Cursor</font> - Tapping the screen generates a left click at the location that was touched, for direct interaction. If you need to be able to move the mouse independently of the touch location, you should use trackpad mode.</li>\t  \t\t\t</ul>\t  \t\t<p>You can quickly change mouse mode by tapping the [...] button and tapping the mouse button on the right.</p>\t\t  \t\t<div align="center"><img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_link/Touch Controls/TouchInterface.png?v=valveisgoodatcaching"></div>  </div>    <div class="button-section" id="button2-section">  \t<div align="center" class="note">  \t\t<h1>How to Modify Touch Controls</h1>  \t</div>\t  \t\t<p>The editing window has a tray in the center, which appears when you select Layout Controls by clicking the … button.

Certain button sets are grouped as a single item for quick placement.</p>\t  \t\t<p>When in edit mode, the screen background will be a transparent blue over the running game. You can touch a single control to select and drag it, use two fingers to scale, or you can use one finger alone to draw a selection box and select multiple controls to move/scale at once. If you\'ve placed a control before, a gray outline will be displayed in the last location you used. If you want to remove a control, simply drag it over toward the ... button, which will turn into a trash can.</p>  \t\t<p>While dragging controls around, they will snap into default positions relative to other related controls. If you don\'t like that location, simply keep moving, or lift your finger and drag again to make small adjustments.</p>  \t  \t\t<p>You can also copy or reset layouts by clicking the […] in the upper left corner of the dialog window.</p>  </div>      <div align="center">  <br><hr><br>  \t<h1>Support Resources</h1>  \t<div class="row">  \t    \t\t<div class="column">  \t\t  \t<a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=108>  \t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_faq.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t\t    <p><font color=white>View other FAQs</font></p>  \t\t  \t</a>  \t\t </div>  \t    \t <div class="column">  \t  \t<a href=http://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions>  \t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_developer.png" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t    <p><font color=white>Visit the community Forums</font></p>  \t\t</a>  \t </div>  \t    \t  <div class="column">  \t\t<a href=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGameIssue/?appid=353380&issueid=354&nodeid=1&return_nodeid=9>\t    \t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_steam.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t    <p><font color=white>Contact Steam Support</font></p>  \t\t</a>\t  \t  </div>  </div>    <p>  <style class="link-streaming-css" type="text/css">html {  \t\tbox-sizing: border-box;  \t}  \t  \t.row:after {  \t    content: "";  \t    display: table;  \t    clear: both;  \t}\t  \t  \tul {    \t\tpadding-left: 10px;  \t}  \t  \tol {    \t\tpadding-left: 10px;  \t}    \t.column {  \t    float: left;  \t\t width: 33.33%;  \t    padding: 10px;  \t}    </style>  </p>  \t  <script type="text/javascript">    \t\tvar headerImage = $("<img/>", {  \t\t\tsrc: "https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_link/SteamLink_Support_Header01.png",  \t\t\tcss: {height: "280px", width: "100%"},  \t\t});    \t\t$(".container").css({"background": "url(https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_universe/bg.jpg) 0px 0px / 100% 6000px no-repeat", "width": "950px", "display": "inline-block"});  \t\t$("#contain_nav_search").after(headerImage);          var nver = window.navigator.appVersion;      if (nver.indexOf("NA") != -1) {          $("#button1").addClass("active-button");          $(".button-section").hide();          $("#button1-section").show();      } else if (nver.indexOf("LAN") != -1) {          $("#button2").addClass("active-button");          $(".button-section").hide();          $("#button2-section").show();        } else {          $("#button1").addClass("active-button");          $("#button1-section").show();      }        $(".ui-button").click(function (clicked) {          var clickedEl = $(this).attr("id");          $(".active-button").removeClass("active-button");          $(this).addClass("active-button");          $(".button-section").hide();          $("#"+clickedEl+"-section").show();      });    </script>',

How can I improve the experience?</h4>  \t\t<p>Using a wired network is strongly recommended with the Raspberry Pi.</p>                  <p>You can also try switching to the ‘Fast’ streaming quality option from the Streaming settings in the Steam Link. You can find out more information about improving wireless experience <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4950-EBNM-7843">here</a>.</p>  \t  \t<h4>Can I use the Steam Controller in Bluetooth mode?</h4>  \t\t<p>Bluetooth mode is not supported on the Raspberry Pi. The wireless dongle that came with your Steam Controller is lower latency and works well. Your Steam Controller can be paired with the dongle in the controller settings in the Steam Link app.</p>    \t<h4>Can I use an input device not listed on this page?</h4>  \t\t<p>Steam Support is unable to provide assistance with unsupported devices, however, we do have an active community that may have found solutions to the issue you’ve encountered.</p>  \t\t<p>Please visit the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/6/">Steam Link section of the Steam Discussion forums.</a></p>    \t<h4>Can I use surround sound?</h4>  \t\t<p>Surround sound works using HDMI multi-channel PCM. If your sound system only supports encoded surround sound (AC3, Dolby DTS, etc.) you should use Stereo audio streaming settings.</p>  </div>\t    <div class="button-section" id="button2-section">  \t<div align="center" class="note">  \t\t<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>  \t</div>\t    \t<h4>Experiencing Performance Issues?</h4>  \t\t<p>If you are experiencing performance issues please ensure that your <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4950-EBNM-7843">settings are optimized for Streaming.</a></p>    \t<h4>XBox triggers reversed?</h4>  \t\t<p>If the Xbox controller triggers are reversed, you are probably using the unsupported xboxdrv gamepad driver. You can go to the Steam Link app controller settings and remap your controller to work with this driver.</p>  \t\t\t\t  \t<h4>Contacting Steam Support</h4>  \t\t<p>If you have other issues or questions, contact <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGameIssue/?appid=353380&issueid=354&nodeid=1&return_nodeid=9">Steam Support</a> and attach the <em><font color="white">remote_connections.txt</font></em> and <em><font color="white">streaming_log.txt</em></font> files to your ticket.</p>  \t\t<p>The default location for this file on your PC is <em><font color="white">C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\logs</font></em></p>\t\t\t\t  </div>    <div align="center">  <br><hr><br>  \t<h1>Support Resources</h1>  \t<div class="row">  \t    \t\t<div class="column">  \t\t  \t<a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=108>  \t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_faq.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t\t    <p><font color=white>View other FAQs</font></p>  \t\t  \t</a>  \t\t </div>  \t    \t <div class="column">  \t  \t<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/6/">  \t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_developer.png" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t    <p><font color=white>Visit the community Forums</font></p>  \t\t</a>  \t </div>  \t    \t  <div class="column">  \t\t<a href=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGameIssue/?appid=353380&issueid=354&nodeid=1&return_nodeid=9>\t    \t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_steam.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t    <p><font color=white>Contact Steam Support</font></p>  \t\t</a>\t  \t  </div>  </div>        <p>  <style class="link-streaming-css" type="text/css">html {  \t\tbox-sizing: border-box;  \t}  \t  \t.row:after {  \t    content: "";  \t    display: table;  \t    clear: both;  \t}\t  \t  \tul {    \t\tpadding-left: 10px;  \t}  \t  \tol {    \t\tpadding-left: 10px;  \t}    \t.column {  \t    float: left;  \t\t width: 33.33%;  \t    padding: 10px;  \t}    </style>  </p>  \t  <script type="text/javascript">    \t\tvar headerImage = $("<img/>", {  \t\t\tsrc: "https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_universe/Hardware_SteamLogo_Banner.png",  \t\t\tcss: {height: "280px", width: "100%"},  \t\t});    \t\t$(".container").css({"background": "url(https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_universe/bg.jpg) 0px 0px / 100% 6000px no-repeat", "width": "950px", "display": "inline-block"});  \t\t$("#contain_nav_search").after(headerImage);          var nver = window.navigator.appVersion;      if (nver.indexOf("NA") != -1) {          $("#button1").addClass("active-button");          $(".button-section").hide();          $("#button1-section").show();      } else if (nver.indexOf("LAN") != -1) {          $("#button2").addClass("active-button");          $(".button-section").hide();          $("#button2-section").show();        } else {          $("#button1").addClass("active-button");          $("#button1-section").show();      }        $(".ui-button").click(function (clicked) {          var clickedEl = $(this).attr("id");          $(".active-button").removeClass("active-button");          $(this).addClass("active-button");          $(".button-section").hide();          $("#"+clickedEl+"-section").show();      });    </script>',

If you are unable to do so or you are returning a component part for replacement, please follow the instructions below to ensure no damage occurs while your package is in transit.</p>  \t  \t<h4>Choosing the right box</h4>  \t<p>Obtain bubble wrap and a sturdy shipping box that is large enough to contain Hardware when it is wrapped up.</p>  \t<div align="center"><img src="https://support.steampowered.com/steamvr/Packaging_Instructions/Base_Bubble_Open.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px; padding-bottom: 10px;"></div>  \t<p>This box should not be too large: room for excessive movement may damage the product during transport.</p>  \t  \t<h4>Should I include anything else?</h4>  \t<p>Yes – you should include the product’s RMA sheet and any additional components the sheet requests to send along.</p>  \t<p>Make sure the serial number of the device you are returning matches the serial number on the RMA sheet that is associated with your return.</p>  \t<p>The RMA includes instructions for returning the product, and these instructions may also require that you include specific component parts with your return. Make sure you include all these requested parts with your return, as well as the RMA instructions sheet itself. You may experience delays in processing if the instructions are not followed.</p>  \t<p><font color="#DA70D6">Important:</font> Do not send any unspecified items with your return. They will not be returned to you. </p>    \t<h4>Prepping your device</h4>  \t<p>Wrap the device evenly in bubble wrap and place it in the box. Ensure that it sits in the box snugly to prevent unnecessary movement during shipping. Valve is not responsible for any shipping damage.</p>  \t<p>Some product-specific packaging tips:</p>  \t<ul>  \t\t<li><font color="#DA70D6"><b>Index Base Stations</b></font> - Pack snugly so bases don’t move around.</li>  \t\t\t<div align="center"><img src="https://support.steampowered.com/steamvr/Packaging_Instructions/Base_Bubble_Wrapped.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"></div>  <p><i>Note: If you are replacing your Index Base Station, please keep your wall mount and power supply.

INSTEAD, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO THE STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND LEGAL RECOURSES PROVIDED BY YOUR HOME JURISDICTION.</p>  <p>IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER WHO LIVES IN AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, OR THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (CANADA), THE LIMITED WARRANTY CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU; INSTEAD YOU ARE ENTITLED TO THE STATUTORY WARRANTIES PROVIDED BY YOUR HOME JURISDICTION.</p>  <p>FURTHERMORE, IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER WHO LIVES IN THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (CANADA), SECTION 6.0 (BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER) DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>      <h3>AGREEMENT</h3>  <p>SECTION 6.0 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED. PLEASE READ IT.</p>  <p>By purchasing or using the Hardware, you agree to this Limited Warranty & Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the Hardware, but return it to Valve for a refund as described in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hardware_order_terms">Hardware Refund Policy.</a> Valve will refund your shipping charges for the least expensive method if you return it for this reason and you have not used the Hardware.</p>  <p>This Limited Warranty & Agreement (“Warranty”) applies to Valve hardware products including without limitation: the Steam® Controller, Steam® Link and Valve Index components and related accessories (individually and collectively, the "Hardware"). This Warranty is provided by Valve Corporation.</p>  <p>For Hardware purchased through the internet, the Hardware will be deemed for all purposes to have been purchased in the country where the original Purchaser (“Purchaser”) lived when buying the Hardware. This Warranty is transferrable to natural persons who receive the Hardware as a gift from the Purchaser; transfer pursuant to this sentence shall not otherwise expand this Warranty. Purchaser remains bound to comply with his or her obligations under this Warranty, including dispute resolution/binding arbitration/class action waiver.</p>      <h3>1.0 Limited Warranty</h3>  <p>Valve warrants the Hardware to be free from defects in materials and workmanship under ordinary consumer use for one (1) year starting from the date of shipment (the "Warranty Period"). During the Warranty Period, if the Hardware does not work properly due to a defect in materials or workmanship, and provided you follow the return instructions set forth below for obtaining warranty service, Valve will, at Valve\'s option, either: (i) repair the Hardware; (ii) replace the Hardware with a new or refurbished product with equal or greater features and functions as the Hardware, or (iii) refund your purchase price. THIS IS YOUR ONLY REMEDY.</p>  <p>Returns. You may have a right to return your Hardware for a refund within a certain number of days after your purchase is made.  To view the Hardware Refund Policy, click <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hardware_order_terms">here.</a></p>  <p>This Warranty applies, to the extent permitted by law, to any replacement Hardware for the remainder of the original Warranty Period or for ninety (90) days, whichever period is longer. All replaced parts, and all Hardware for which a refund is given, shall become the property of Valve.</p>      <h3>2.0 Service and Return Instructions</h3>  <p>For detailed instructions about how to obtain warranty service for your Hardware, visit our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7013-OXBM-2746">RMA Guide</a></p>  <p>You must notify Valve of your warranty claim via the Support Pages during the Warranty Period and prior to shipping or transporting the Hardware to Valve, provide (upon request) a dated sales receipt for the Hardware, and satisfy all other terms and restrictions set forth in this Warranty. In the United States of America, Valve will provide a return shipping address, prepaid shipping label for the outside of the box you ship, and an RMA (Returned Materials Authorization) label, which must be placed inside the box you ship. In other countries, you must return the Hardware to your retail place of purchase or as we may otherwise direct.</p>  <p>Hardware must be transported or shipped to a Valve-designated service center in either the original packaging or in equally protective packaging. Provided the Hardware requires repair or replacement and such repair or replacement is covered by this Warranty, Valve will be responsible for the costs of shipping repaired or replacement Hardware back to you. If the Hardware does not require repair or replacement, you will be responsible for the costs of shipping the Hardware back to you. If you send your Hardware, but do not include all components or information requested in the Support Pages, it could delay your repair, and cost you shipping costs to send the requested components or information so that Valve may repair the Hardware. If the Hardware does require repair or replacement, but the Warranty does not apply (e.g., due to misuse), Valve will contact you regarding replacement options and associated costs and payment options, including the costs of shipping the Hardware back to you. Valve will not return Hardware that is shipped to Valve without pre-authorization or return any part or Hardware that is replaced pursuant to the Warranty.</p>      <h3>3.0 Exclusions</h3>  <p>The Warranty does not apply if the Hardware:</p>  <ol>  \t<li>Has been modified or repaired by anyone except a Valve-designated service center and the cause of the issue for which you seek service is the modification or repair, or damage caused by either;</li>  \t<li>Has had its serial number removed, altered, replaced, defaced, or rendered illegible;</li>  \t<li>Is abused, misused, improperly maintained, mishandled, or neglected;</li>  \t<li>Is damaged by exposure to an accident, natural disaster, or any other events or circumstances outside Valve\'s control;</li>  \t<li>Is used in any manner inconsistent with the acceptable practices identified in the Hardware manual;</li>  \t<li>Is cleaned in any manner other than as specified in the Hardware manual;</li>  \t<li>Is returned for repair or replacement in packaging that does not meet the specifications identified, above, in the return instructions, or is otherwise mishandled by Purchaser or the common carrier prior to its return;</li>  \t<li>Is used for commercial purposes; or</li>  \t<li>Is sold "AS IS" or in "REFURBISHED" condition.</li>  </ol>  <p>This Warranty does not apply to normal usage or ordinary wear and tear, including, without limitation, scratches or marks on the Hardware\'s exterior.</p>      <h3>4.0 Limitations</h3>  <p>IF YOUR LOCAL LAW GIVES YOU ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY, INCLUDING AN IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ITS DURATION IS THE SAME AS THIS WARRANTY. SOME STATES, PROVINCES, OR COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>  <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAW, VALVE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; ANY LOSS OF DATA, PRIVACY, CONFIDENTIALITY, OR PROFITS; OR ANY INABILITY TO USE YOUR HARDWARE. THESE EXCLUSIONS APPLY EVEN IF VALVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME STATES, PROVINCES, AND COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>  <p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW, IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR A REMEDY BEYOND REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, OR REFUND, VALVE’S LIABILITY TO YOU CAN BE NO MORE THAN THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR THE HARDWARE.</p>  <p>THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR COUNTRY TO COUNTRY.</p>      <h3>5.0 Governing Law and Place to Resolve Disputes</h3>  <p>You and Valve agree that this Warranty shall be deemed to have been made and executed in the State of Washington, U.S.A., and Washington law, excluding conflict of laws principles and the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, governs all claims arising out of or relating to: (i) any aspect of the relationship between us; (ii) this Warranty; or (iii) the Hardware, its price, the purchase transaction, or anything else relating to the Hardware except that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs arbitration as far as your country’s laws permit. Subject to the Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver below, you and Valve agree that any claim asserted in any legal proceeding shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction. You and Valve consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. In any dispute, the prevailing party will be entitled to attorneys’ fees and expenses (except arbitration—see Section 6.0 Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver).</p>    <h3>6.0 Agreement: Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver</h3>  <p>This Section 6.0 shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. IN PARTICULAR, IF YOU LIVE IN THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (CANADA) OR THE EUROPEAN UNION, THIS SECTION 6.0 DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>  <p>Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamHardware">Steam Support Site</a>. If Valve is unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and Valve, this Section explains how the parties have agreed to resolve it.</p>  <br>  <p>A. Must Arbitrate All Claims Except IP, Unauthorized Use, Piracy, or Theft</p>  <p>YOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION. THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US; (ii) THIS WARRANTY; OR (iii) THE HARDWARE, ITS PRICE, THE PURCHASE TRANSACTION, OR ANYTHING ELSE RELATING TO THE HARDWARE. IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND INCLUDES ALL CLAIMS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PARTY.</p>  <p>However, this Section 6.0 does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or Valve may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy, or theft.</p>  <p>This Section 6.0 does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.</p>  <p>An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND VALVE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</p>  <br>  <p>B. Try to Resolve Dispute Informally First</p>  <p>You and Valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought. If you and Valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Valve may commence an arbitration. Written notice to Valve must be sent via postal mail to: ATTN: Arbitration Notice, Valve Corporation, P.O. Box 1688, Bellevue, WA 98004.</p>  <br>  <p>C. Arbitration Rules and Fees</p>  <p>The U.S. Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section 6.0 as far as your country’s laws permit. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (or the Commercial Arbitration Rules, if the Consumer Arbitration rules are inapplicable) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) as modified by this Agreement. Rules are available at http://www.adr.org. </p>  <p>The AAA will administer the arbitration. Outside the U.S., Valve will select a neutral arbitration provider that uses these or similar rules. It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>  <p>If you seek $10,000 or less, Valve agrees to promptly reimburse your filing fee and your share if any  of AAA’s arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or were filed for harassment. Valve agrees not to seek its attorneys’ fees or costs unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or were filed for harassment. If you seek more than $10,000 and the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules do not apply, the AAA’s arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and Valve according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.</p>  <br>  <p>D. Individual Binding Arbitration Only</p>  <p>YOU AND VALVE AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, WHISTLE BLOWER ACTION, OR CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA’s RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. You and Valve also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this Agreement and all other actions or arbitrations.</p>  <p>This Agreement does not permit class, collective, or representative arbitration. A court has exclusive authority to rule on any assertion that it does.</p>  <br>  <p>E. What Happens if Part of Section 6.0 Is Found Illegal or Unenforceable</p>  <p> If any part of Section 6.0 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins), except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class, collective, or representative arbitration, all of Section 6.0 will be unenforceable and the claim or dispute will be resolved in court.</p>    <script type="text/javascript">  \tvar headerImage = $("<img/>", {  \t\tsrc: "https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_universe/SteamHardware_Warranty_Header.png",  \t\tcss: {height: "320px", width: "100%"}  \t});      \t$("#contain_nav_search").after(headerImage);    \t// hack for hiding deskpro p tag around style  \t$(".steam-compliance-css").parent("p").css("display", "none")    \t$("document").ready(function () {  \t\t$("#question").hide();  \t});  </script>',

The aesthetics of Dota 2 are built from a set of principles that help keep each hero immediately and uniquely identifiable from above during gameplay. We&rsquo;re going to go over exactly what these principles are, how we used them to design the heroes and how you can apply them to custom items.</span></span></p>    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Be aware that the principles on this page are important general design concepts that apply to the readability and quality execution of <strong>all</strong> items, including inventive items that thoughtfully differ from the default colors and silhouettes.

To create inventive but still functional items, the artist needs to thoughtfully decide where to push the boundaries and where to balance those extremes by staying closer to familiar elements. Additional factors such as Valve&#39;s animations, character poses and speed of travel can contribute to hero identification and should be considered in conjunction with customized items. Frequently evaluating the items in game view, getting feedback from others, and being open to making adjustments can help artists achieve a good balance of novelty and readability. What is most important is that custom items visually support gameplay using all of the principles described on this page. Each of these aspects is an important part of Dota 2&rsquo;s unique design aesthetic.</span></span></li>  </ul>    <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>    <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For technical information about authoring models, shaders, uvs and more, please follow the links on the&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.dota2.com/workshop/">Dota 2 Item Workshop&nbsp;Guidelines Homepage</a></span></span></p>  ',

There are many resources online that can help you through the incorporation process for your local government.</font></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Once your team&#39;s corporate entity has been set up, your corporate team Steam account can be set up by following the steps on the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb/8860-WOSX-7503/dota-2-account-preparation-for-workshop-item-submission" target="_blank">Account Preparation for Workshop Item Submission<font color="#1f497d">.</font></a>page.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">You should use the same Steam account to submit or share in the revenue of all items and logos for your team.

If you decide to try a profoundly different silhouette for some items, you may need to bring colors or other items closer to what&#39;s recognizable for the hero&nbsp;to compensate for this. Our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb/9334-YDXV-8590/dota-2-workshop-character-art-guide">Character Art guide</a> has more information about achieving this balance.</span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Be careful if your mesh drastically differs from the default hero skeleton in an area that has&nbsp;highly active joints, such as wings. If your mesh distorts too much during animations you may have to revise the mesh to more closely follow the skeleton.</span></li>  </ul>    <p><a id="polygons" name="polygons"></a></p>    <h2><strong><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">POLYGONS</span></span></strong></h2>    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img alt="" src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/models/13_art_uv_alchemist.jpg" style="text-align: center; width: 590px; height: 525px;" /></span></span></p>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Like <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9334-YDXV-8590#gradient">textures</a>, geometry typically has a gradient, with the lowest amount of polygons being used around the feet/lower torso and highest density around the head and upper torso.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Make every triangle count. A polygon should either be contributing to the silhouette and/or helping deformations. </span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In situations where the texture resolution doesn&#39;t support clean edges on prominent areas of an item, for example, the edge of a mane or saddle on a mount, you may want to create these edges with geometry instead of with the texture. It helps to consider needs like this that are affected by your item budget&nbsp;early in your&nbsp;concept phase.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Polygons are also added in cases where the normal map isn&#39;t projecting properly due to lack of geometry.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Avoid creating long triangles as they tend to cause shading errors, especially during animations.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">It is helpful if you triangulate your model&nbsp;before submission to confirm that the final mesh is what you intend. If you don&#39;t, our tools will triangulate the mesh but the results may look different from what you authored.</span></li>  </ul>    <p><a name="basemodel"></a></p>    <h2><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">BASE MODEL INTERACTION</span></span></b></h2>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Most hero items are created on top of the geometry of the bare hero. For example, the geometry of a hero&#39;s forearms is not removed; his or her bracers sit on top of it.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Only if a body part is designated as an item slot - such as Pudge and Tusk&#39;s left arm or Faceless Void&#39;s head - can it be totally replaced by a custom item.&nbsp;</span></li>  </ul>    <p><a name="iteminteraction"></a></p>    <h2><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">INTERACTION WITH OTHER HERO WEARABLE ITEMS</span></span></b></h2>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Use &quot;Select Wearables&quot; in the Preview Model window of the item workshop tool&nbsp;to&nbsp;test&nbsp;how your hero wearable items&nbsp;interact with each other and with&nbsp;the hero&#39;s existing items during idle, loadout, portrait, and other important&nbsp;animations. You can save your wearable selections in the workshop session for the main item.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since people are likely to&nbsp;equip Arcana or Immortal items if they have them, it&#39;s&nbsp;important to test your items in conjunction with these models.

            "<p>When installing or updating a game, Steam displays an error message:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>An error occurred while updating <i>[game title]</i></li>  \t<li>An error occurred while installing <i>[game title]</i></li>  </ul>  <p>This is a common type of error that can occur any time a game is updated or installed on Steam</p>   <p>The error results when Steam is not able to complete the installation. The specific reason for the error will be shown in the parenthesis at the end of the error message.</p>",
            '<h4>Basic Steam Troubleshooting</h4>  <p>The following fixes will resolve most update and installation errors with Steam. They can be performed with a minimal amount of technical knowledge.</p>    <h5>Restart Computer</h5>  \t<p>It\'s always a good first step to make sure that you restart Steam as well as your computer.</p>  \t<p>Restarting the computer flushes all kinds of system states and caches, while resetting other programs and releasing locks on files and other resources.</p>    <h5>Clear Download Cache</h5>  \t<p>Clearing the Steam download cache will cause the Steam client to flush locally cached configuration data and acquire it from the Steam servers again.</p>   \t<p>Navigate to your Steam -> Settings -> Downloads -> Clear Download Cache</p>    <h5>Repair Library Folder</h5>  \t<p>The Steam library folder contains all of your installed games on disk. These folders need to be writable by all users in order to update properly. Sometimes these user permissions break and need to be refreshed.</p>  \t<p>Navigate to your Steam -> Settings -> Downloads -> Steam Library Folders -> Right click on folder -> Repair Folder</p>    <h5>Verify Local Files</h5>  \t<p>Sometimes files on hard-disks and other storage devices become corrupted because of bad hardware, software crashes, power surges etc. Steam can verify the correctness over installed game files and fix them if necessary.</p>  \t<p>Find Game in Library -> Manage menu -> Properties -> Local Files -> Verify Integrity of Game Files</p>    <h5>Change Download Region</h5>  \t<p>The Steam content system is divided into geographical regions. The Steam client automatically detects its current region and uses content servers located in that region for best performance. Sometimes, servers in a specific region may be slow, overloaded or have a hardware failure causing download issues. It is advisable to temporarily switch to a different download region to use another set of content servers.</p>  \t<p>Steam -> Settings -> Downloads -> Download Region. You may need to test several regions other than your own.</p>    <h5>Reinstall Steam</h5>  \t<p>The Steam installer can be downloaded here: (<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">http://store.steampowered.com/about/</a>) and reinstalled to the same location where it is already installed.</p>   \t<p>This may fix potential issues with Steam client and service files. Installing into same location will preserve all installed games.</p>   \t<p>WARNING! Uninstalling Steam will delete all game content.</p>    <h5>Move Game Folder</h5>  \t<p>It can be very helpful to test the issue by installing on an alternate hard drive. If one is already available, you can create a new Steam library folder on this drive. You can then install new games into this Steam library folder or move already installed games there.</p>  \t<p>Steam -> Settings -> Downloads -> Steam Library Folders -> Add new Library folder</p>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <h4>Advanced Troubleshooting</h4>  <p>If the error is still occurring after following the fixes outlined above, it is possible that something outside of Steam is responsible.</p>  <p>Because these are advanced troubleshooting steps, we highly recommend that you contact a local IT support specialist in your area for further assistance with these steps.</p>    <h5>Refresh Local Network Hardware</h5>  \t<p>This includes restarting all modems & routers. Network hardware can get into slow/broken state after running for a long time.</p>    <h5>Update System & Drivers</h5>  \t<p>Make sure your operating system and hardware drivers are all up to date.</p>   \t<p>For Windows: Start → search "update" → run "Check for Updates"</p>  \t<p>For Mac: drivers cannot be updated separately; only the operating system can be updated.</p>\t    <h5>Investigate Firewalls</h5>  \t<p>Certain firewalls may prevent Steam from talking to its servers. You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that the Firewall is not interfering. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes. It may be necessary to add exceptions in your firewalls for Steam.</p>    <h5>Investigate Anti-Virus Software</h5>  \t<p>AV software hooks very deep into user systems and can affect disk and network operations which will cause issues with Steam. Some games also use copy protection technology that can appear as malicious software to an AV scanner, resulting in potential false-positive alerts.</p>   \t<p>You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that your AV software is not interfering with Steam. You may even need to temporarily disable it for testing purposes. It may also be necessary to add exceptions for Steam in your AV configuration (for example, excluding Steam Library folders from live monitoring services).</p>  \t  <h5>Investigate Other Programs & Services</h5>  \t<p>Any software that modifies or monitors system, disk or network activity can cause issues while downloading or running a game. These programs and services can run in the background and are typically associated with software like Anti-Virus, ad-blockers, web-optimizers, firewalls, system cleaners, recording software, proxies, performance boosters etc.</p>   \t<p>You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to ensure that these services & programs are not interfering with Steam. You may even need to temporarily disable them for testing purposes.</p>    <h5>Disable Overclocking</h5>  \t<p>Some users overclock their hardware to gain more performance while running their system outside of manufacturer recommended settings. This can cause memory and file corruption and should be disabled (usually in the computer BIOS).</p>    <h5>Test Online Connection</h5>  \t<p>Some Internet providers cache or compress online data to save bandwidth (especially cellphone networks). This can cause issues with Steam. It is a good idea to test the issue by connecting to an entirely different network, preferably from a different service provider.</p>    <h5>Check Hard Drive for Errors</h5>  \t<p>All storage drives/devices can be affected by file corruption, especially if it is older or running under a heavy load. You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to investigate possible issues with your Hard Drive</p>  \t<p>For Windows: My PC → Right Click on Drive → Properties → Tools → Error checking</p>  \t<p>For Mac OSX: Disk Utility → Click on Drive → Click First Aid (For older OSX versions: click Repair Disk Permissions)</p>    <h5>Check RAM for Errors</h5>  \t<p>Memory errors can cause issues with the Steam installation process, as well as gameplay. You\'ll want to work with a tech support specialist to investigate possible issues with your system memory.</p>  \t<p>Windows : Start -> Find "mdsched" and run Windows memory Diagnostic</p>',

The best way to create a mesh for this is to treat it as a single polygon. </span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Keep in mind that particles will be created from all vertices in the mesh, so do not attempt to create valid convex or closed triangles in the traditional sense if this creates vertices in undesired locations.</span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">While it is possible to use the vertices from the original model mesh, generally speaking the density will not end up being appropriate for the effect. </span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">In addition, UV&#39;s, hard edges, etc. can create duplicate vertices in some cases which is generally undesirable.</span></li>  </ul>    <p><a name="particlecounts"></a></p>    <h2><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">PARTICLE VERTEX LIMITS AND CONTEXT</span></span></b></h2>    <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Here are the particle vertex count limits and ambient effect display context for effects models for these hero items:</span></span></p>    <ul>  \t<li><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Abaddon</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"> - weapon - 128, constant</span></li>  \t<li><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Anti-Mage</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"> - weapon and offhand - 128 each, constant</span></li>  \t<li><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Bounty Hunter</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"> - weapon and offhand - 120 each, displays when <b>Jinada</b> ability (available at Level 1) is enabled and is not in cooldown.</span></li>  \t<li><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Doom</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"> - weapon - 48, constant</span></li>  \t<li><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ember Spirit</span></span></b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> - weapon and offhand - 32 each, constant</span></span></li>  \t<li><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Juggernaut </span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">- weapon - 128, constant</span></li>  \t<li><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Kunkka</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"> - weapon - 64, displays when his <b>Tidebringer</b> ability (available at Level 1) is enabled and is not in cooldown.</span></li>  \t<li><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Phantom Assassin</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"> - weapon - 120, displays when <b>Coup de Grace</b> ability&nbsp;(available at Level 6)&nbsp;is enabled.</span></li>  \t<li><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Skywrath Mage</span></span></b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> - weapon - 128, constant</span></span></li>  \t<li><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Terrorblade</span></span></b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> - two part&nbsp;weapon in one slot - 128 total for both, constant</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Underlord</span></span></b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> - weapon - 80, displays when his <strong>Atrophy Aura</strong> ability (available at Level 1) is enabled and a nearby enemy dies while under the effect.

Trade and market holds protect items if a user\'s account is compromised. These holds also give users a way to recover items before they are lost. Even if a hijacker manages to access your account, you can prevent them from stealing your items by canceling any transactions that are on hold.</p>    <p><a name="1"></a></p>    <h3>What is a trade hold?</h3>    <p>A trade hold is a period of time after a trade is accepted by both parties where the items traded are held by Steam before they are delivered. Trade holds last up to 15 days. If you\'re trading items with a friend, and you\'ve been friends for more than 1 year, the hold is 1 day.</p>    <p><a name="2"></a></p>    <h3>What is a market hold?</h3>    <p>A market hold is a period of time after a sell listing is created where the items are held by Steam before they are available on the Community Market.</p>    <p><a name="3"></a></p>    <h3>Why are holds necessary?</h3>    <p>Holds protect your items. Steam accounts are valuable, especially if they have items, and that makes them appealing to thieves. Anyone participating in trading or the Community Market should have the highest level of security on their account. If you haven\'t protected your account with a physical device (using the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator), a hold will give you protection in the form of additional time to discover your account has been compromised and to prevent items from leaving your account.</p>    <p><br />  For more information, please review <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/19618/">this</a> news post</p>    <p><a name="4"></a></p>    <h3>How does it work?</h3>    <p>If you haven\'t had your account protected by a Mobile Authenticator for at least the last 7 days, items leaving your account will be held by Steam for up to 15 days. This provides you time to discover any transactions on hold that you didn\'t make. If you find that your account has been compromised, you can change your Steam account password and cancel any item transactions that are pending before your items are stolen.</p>    <p><br />  When you cancel a trade that is being held by Steam, we\'ll presume that you intercepted a hijacker and you\'ll see a 7 day trading cooldown to prevent any further unauthorized attempts to trade away items. This cooldown is for your protection and cannot be removed by Steam Support.</p>    <p><a name="5"></a></p>    <h3>How can I remove the need for a trade or market hold?</h3>    <p>Trade and market holds are no longer necessary when you protect your account with a Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator. Using a physical device (your smartphone) to confirm item transactions ensures that you and only you can quickly and securely trade or sell your items. You can get the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/mobile/">Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator</a> for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices. Items will no longer be held after you have had the authenticator enabled for 7 days.</p>',

Every hero, item, courier, and creep makes use of the shader. Each texture works in conjunction with all the others.</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">All shader settings for all of a hero&#39;s items will be derived from the base hero material. The game automatically creates a single model and texture out of the hero and its currently equipped items, assigning a single shader to everything. We do not support custom item shaders that differ from the default item shader. For example, an additive item on a solid hero isn&#39;t supported, but the hero material is very powerful and supports a range of effects, so there is almost always a way to achieve the desired effect.&nbsp;</span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">We do not support double-sided materials; you will need to create geometry where a backside is needed.&nbsp;</font></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Some masks, like the Metalness Mask, Detail Mask, and Diffuse Mask, are only used on certain heroes or items.</span></li>  </ul>    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ogre Magi textures and shader masks: </span></span></strong></h2>    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Base Model, Color, Normal, Self Illumination,&nbsp;</span></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Specular, Rimlight, Base Tint, and Specular Exponent</span></span></strong></p>    <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/shaders/ogre_magi_base_all_masks_s2.jpg?v=valveisgoodatcaching" style="border-width: 1px;

Internally we offset overlapping UVs +1 in U direction.</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Texture seams are better kept to a minimum as they break up the vertices and add to an item&#39;s vertex count.</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In general, you can push an item&#39;s UVs to the texture borders closer than usual because hero&#39;s and item&#39;s textures are all added together in-engine.</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Mirror UVs as much as possible. Reserve asymmetry for areas that are most prominent in the portrait and game cameras. In the example above with Brewmaster,&nbsp;all solid colored areas have been overlapped.</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">On Dota heroes, face UVs&nbsp;occupy at least 25% of the body&rsquo;s UVs so that the portraits have sufficient detail. Bear this in mind when creating UVs for replacement head items or for the heads of NPCs and hero mounts that will be seen prominently in portraits or in the loadout.</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Most of the mounts ridden by Dota heroes have somewhat solid&nbsp;body coloring instead of&nbsp;skin&nbsp;covered with sharply defined details like stripes or spots. This gives our artists the option to use smaller UV space for the simpler body areas&nbsp;and use larger UV space for more important details on the mounts&#39; heads, armor, tails, and fur or feather accents. </span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">All swappable costume items should be UV&rsquo;d in their own unique 0 to 1 space (creating a unique texture).</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Like <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9334-YDXV-8590#gradient">textures</a>, UVs also typically have a density gradient with the lowest amount of UV space towards the feet/lower torso and largest UV space toward the head and upper torso. Portrait and game camera should inform these decisions.</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Eyes with a lot of detail should be a separate, larger UV island.</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Waste as little space as possible when laying out UV islands without packing it too tight. Always leave approximately 5-10 pixels (on a 2k source texture) between each shell and the edges of the 0 to 1 space. On some hardware, smaller versions of the textures will be loaded, and this can cause bleeding artifacts if the islands are packed too tightly.</span></span></li>  \t<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Grouping UV islands that will be colored similarly helps retain color separations when smaller versions of the textures are loaded.&nbsp;</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.dota2.com/workshop/">Dota 2 Item Workshop&nbsp;Guidelines Homepage</a></span></span></p>  ',

They function in two ways: as new songs to wholly replace existing tracks in menus and in-game, and as a series of layered tracks which are dynamically mixed in order to enhance events occurring during a match.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Here is an example music pack from The International 4: <a href="http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/audio/workshop_music_pack/music_pack_ti4.zip" target="_blank">Example Download</a></span></span></li>  </ul>    <p><a name="audioquality"></a></p>    <hr />  <h2>&nbsp;</h2>    <h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>AUDIO QUALITY AND DYNAMIC RANGE</b></span></span></h2>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">Submit your files via the Music Pack submission tool in stereo, 16 or 24 bit, 48Khz WAV format.&nbsp;</font></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial">We suggest submitting &ldquo;unmastered&rdquo; mixes, or at least using a very light touch with any final mastering plug ins (such as L1) so that we can master your tracks appropriate to their function in the game.

During this time, the player is navigating the UI, and is not in a match.</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ui_startup ~1:00-2:00</span></span></b></p>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This track begins playing when the game client is started, and can be stopped by player input.

UI_main can be stopped by player input. If this track is allowed to play to its end, it will restart after a 10 to 15 second gap of silence. This will continue until the player either joins a match, or closes the game client.</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p><a name="pregame"></a></p>    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>    <h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>PRE-GAME TRACKS</b></span></span></h2>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">These are complete tracks that play during the Hero Selection phase, and in the Preparation phase of a match (before the horn of battle).</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ui_hero_select ~1:00 loop</span></span></b></p>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This is a looping track that repeats for as long as the player is in the Hero Selection phase of the game. Hero selection duration can last from less than 1 minute, to over 10 minutes. If pick-up beats or intro bars are used, the loop duration can be less than the full file length. This track stops when the hero selection screen closes and the match begins.</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; countdown ~2:30</span></span></b></p>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This track plays during the Preparation phase of the game. Players are now preparing their selected heroes for the match, and the countdown to battle has begun. Usually this track will be stopped before it ends when the timer reaches t-minus 10 seconds and the in-game battle horns play (in F#). The duration of this phase is somewhat indeterminate as players can pause the game while the track continues to play. If the game remains paused such that the track reaches its end, it simply stops.</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p><a name="ingame"></a></p>    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>    <h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>IN GAME TRACKS</b></span></span></h2>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Throughout a match, music is created by dynamically combining a series of tracks based on the events in the game.</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p><a name="laning"></a></p>    <h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </b></span></span></h2>    <h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </b><u><b>Laning Tracks and Layers</b></u></span></span></h2>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;Laning tracks consist of three synchronized musical layers (rendered as separate files, or stems) that play together while the volume of each layer is individually controlled by game events in real time to create a &ldquo;music intensity&rdquo; value. They are by far the most-played compositions in a typical match, so we recommend a minimum runtime of 100 seconds per track.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In general, layer_01 of each set should be able to function as the basis or backbone of the track since the other layers may be silent at times. When the volume of layer_02 is increased by the intensity value, it should add musical intensity (however you define that for your composition) to layer_01. Similarly, layer_03 should add musical intensity to both layer_01 and layer_02 as its volume is increased.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The active Laning track can be stopped at any time by a higher intensity Track in response to action in the game, usually a Battle track or the Killed track. If the Laning track is not stopped it will play to completion, after which there will be a 10 to 20 second pause, then one of the other Laning Tracks will begin.</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; laning_01_layer_01 &gt;1:40</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; laning_01_layer_02 &quot;</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; laning_01_layer_03 &quot;</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; laning_02_layer_01 &gt;1:40</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; laning_02_layer_02 &quot;</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; laning_02_layer_03 &quot;</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; laning_03_layer_01 &gt;1:40</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; laning_03_layer_02 &quot;</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; laning_03_layer_03 &quot;</span></span></b></p>    <p><a name="battle"></a></p>    <h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </b></span></span></h2>    <h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </b><u><b>Battle Tracks</b></u></span></span></h2>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">These begin when the game events drive the music intensity value higher than the Laning track values. Like the Laning tracks, Battle tracks are shuffle-selected by the music engine. Any Battle track can interrupt any Laning track. Though it&rsquo;s rare for a battle to last for more than 30 seconds, Battle tracks should be able to loop in musically pleasing fashion. However, the entire file need not loop if pick-up beats are used at the top of the composition. The music engine can seamlessly loop back to any point in the file.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Though Battle tracks need to loop, each track also requires a short end segment or coda lasting one or two bars that will play when the battle is over. This segment can also have a pick up beat if needed as well; the music engine will properly align the downbeat and crossfade the end segment in over the Battle track in a musical fashion.</span></span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The active Battle track will be stopped by the Killed track if the player&rsquo;s hero dies. If the hero survives the battle and the intensity of the match returns to Laning levels (for example, when a fight is over), the music engine will queue and play the appropriate battle_XX_end file at the next musical transition point, usually a bar line.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">You are encouraged to include markers or regions as well as loop points or other standard metadata in your Battle Track wav files to indicate your preferred transition points and to indicate the bpm value of the track.</span></li>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the battle_XX_end track plays, assuming no more action, a random Laning set will be chosen to play next.&nbsp;</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; battle_01 ~0:40</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; battle_01_end ~0:10</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; battle_02 ~0:40</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; battle_02_end ~0:10</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; battle_03 ~0:40</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; battle_03_end ~0:10</span></span></b></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="roshan"></a></p>    <h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </b><u><b>Roshan Tracks</b></u></span></span></h2>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;These tracks play while the player is fighting the monster Roshan, a critical moment in any match.</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NOTE: The stinger that plays when Roshan is killed is not&nbsp;</span></span></b><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">replaced by Dota 2 Music Packs.</span></span></b></p>    <p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; roshan ~0:45</span></span></b></p>    <ul>  \t<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This track functions similarly to the Battle Tracks, though it plays when the player is fighting the large neutral boss monster Roshan.

Steam offers refunds, as described here <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/">http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/</a>. How do these work together?</p>    <p>European law principally provides a right of withdrawal on software sales. However, it can be and typically is excluded for boxed software that has been opened and for digitally provided content once it is provided to the end user. This is what happens when you make a transaction on Steam: The EU statutory right of withdrawal ends 14 days after your purchase or the moment you start downloading the content and services for the first time (whichever is sooner).</p>    <p>At the same time, Steam voluntarily offers refunds to all of its customers worldwide in a way that is much more customer-friendly than our legal obligations. In particular, for some hardware we offer 30 days instead of the statutory 14, and for digital games we allow you to try them for up to two hours, whereas your statutory right of withdrawal does not give you a chance to try out games at all. You can find the details of our voluntary refund policy here:<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/">http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/</a>.</p>    <p>As a result, even if your statutory right of withdrawal ends, you may still request a refund of your purchase pursuant to our own refund policy.</p>    <h3>Legal Text</h3>    <p>We are obligated as merchants to inform you of the EU right of withdrawal in very specific legal terms, which you can find below. If these should in any way differ from our more informal wording, the below terms shall prevail towards any EU consumer. </p>    <h4 class="indent">Right of withdrawal</h4>    <p class="indent">As a Steam user domiciled in a European Union member country, you have the right to withdraw from any purchase on Steam without giving any reason. </p>    <p class="indent">For any <u><b>digital content</b></u> purchased online, you have agreed upon checkout that the withdrawal period will expire 14 days after you purchase such digital content or when you start downloading the content for the first time, whichever is sooner. For <u><b>hardware</b></u>, the withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by you acquires, physical possession of the goods. </p>    <p class="indent">To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform Valve Corporation of your decision to withdraw from the purchase by an unequivocal statement (e.g. by a letter sent to Valve Corporation, 10400 NE 4th St., Bellevue, WA 98004, United States). You may attach the model withdrawal form available below, but it is not mandatory. </p>    <p class="indent">The easiest way to exercise your right of withdrawal is by using the support form on our website at http://help.steampowered.com. If you do so, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a withdrawal on a durable medium (e.g. by e-mail) without delay.</p>    <p class="indent">To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>    <h4 class="indent">Effects of withdrawal</h4>    <p class="indent">If you exercise your right of withdrawal, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>    <p class="indent">For hardware, we may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever is the earliest. You shall send back the goods to our returns warehouse without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate your withdrawal from this contract to us. The deadline is met if you send back the goods before the period of 14 days has expired. You will have to bear the direct cost of returning the goods. You are only liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the goods.</p>    <p class="indent">If hardware you wish to return was bundled with a Subscription, the Subscription is automatically cancelled with your return of the hardware.</p>    <h4 class="indent">Exceptions from the right of withdrawal:</h4>    <p class="indent">Pursuant to European Law, the statutory right of withdrawal is not applicable as regards the following:  <ol type="a" class="indent">  <li>service contracts after the service has been fully performed if the performance has begun with the consumer’s prior express consent, and with the acknowledgement that he will lose his right of withdrawal once the contract has been fully performed by the trader;</li>  <li>the supply of goods made to the consumer’s specifications or clearly personalized;</li>  <li>the supply of goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with other items;</li>  <li>the supply of sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed computer software which were unsealed after delivery;</li>  <li>the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the consumer’s prior express consent and his acknowledgment that he thereby loses his right of withdrawal.</li>  </ol>  </p>    <p class="indent"><b>WITHDRAWAL FORM:</b><br>  <q>To Valve Corporation, 10400 NE 4th St., Suite 1400, Bellevue, WA 98004<br>  I hereby give notice that I withdraw from my contract of sale for the provision of the following item: [identify your purchase and insert your purchase], ordered on [insert date of purchase].<br>  [Insert your name and address as well as the name of your Steam Account]<br>  [Signature – only if this form is notified on paper]<br>  [Insert date]</q>  </p>    <p class="indent">Again, for the fastest and easiest way to exercise your right of withdrawal, we recommend using the online help form provided at <a href="http://help.steampowered.com">http://help.steampowered.com</a>. </p>  <script type="text/javascript">  \tvar headerImage = $("<img/>", {  \t\tsrc: "https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_universe/Hardware_SteamLogo_Banner.png",  \t\tcss: {height: "320px", width: "100%"}  \t});      \t$("#contain_nav_search").after(headerImage);    \t// hack for hiding deskpro p tag around style  \t$(".steam-header-css").parent("p").css("display", "none")    \t$("document").ready(function () {  \t\t$("#question").hide();  \t})  </script>',

            "How do I diagnose and report network problems?",
            "<p>This article explains some basic steps you can take to diagnose network-related problems&nbsp;and what information to share when communicating with support or posting on forums.</p>",
            "<h2>Different types of network problems</h2>    <p>The first thing to do is categorize the type of problem. Pay close attention to what's happening on your screen, and any FPS or ping readouts, to be clear about the nature of the problem.</p>    <ul>  \t<li><b>Client-side frame rate problems</b> are not network problems, but people often confuse the two, and use words like &quot;lagging&quot; or &quot;hitching&quot; to describe both problems. When you have a client-side frame rate problem, the whole screen will freeze (&quot;frame rate hitching&quot;) or the animation of the entire screen will stop being fluid. In contrast, if your frame rate is smooth, but characters walk in place or warp around, or some screen elements continue animating while others are jerky, or if you have an FPS indicator and it doesn't drop, then you probably have a network problem.</li>  \t<li><b>High latency</b> is when packets consistently take a long time to reach the gameserver and back. (This roundtrip time is usually called the &quot;ping&quot;.) This can manifest itself in a few different ways, depending on the game. There might be a noticeable delay between the time you perform some input, such as clicking to issue an order or fire a weapon, and when you see the appropriate response on your screen. Another sign of high ping, common in first person shooters, is when bullets seems to miss their targets even though it looked like it should have hit them, or when you get shot &quot;from around a corner.&quot; Or if you run near an obstacle and you seem to slide around after a little delay, even though on your screen you didn't hit the obstacle. This is because your computer is trying to predict what will happen on the server, but what happened on the server didn't match up with that prediction, and your computer is trying to correct the situation after it gets the update from the server of what &quot;really&quot; happened.</li>  \t<li><b>Packet loss</b> happens when packets are sent by your client or the gameserver, but they are not received by the other side. In most of the world, packet loss above 1% is relatively rare, and a small amount of packet loss on this scale is usually not noticeable. Depending on the game, packet loss of 10% or higher can seriously degrade the experience. Packet loss can share many of the same symptoms as high latency, so if you don't have an in-game readout, it can be difficult to tell the difference between the two problems. In general, packet loss tends to be a bit more erratic and &quot;bursty&quot;.<br />  \t<br />  \tTypically packet loss is symmetric, meaning that packets sent to the gameserver are dropped about as often as packets sent by the gameserver to your client. However, sometimes one direction has more loss than the other. When this happens, it might prevent packet loss readouts from diagnosing the problem, depending on the method used to measure packet loss. For example, if the game measures packet loss based on gaps in sequence numbers attached to incoming packets, it will not be able to detect outgoing packet loss. The ping test described below is based on loss of roundtrip packets, so it can detect packet loss, even if it's asymmetric.</li>  \t<li><b>NAT problems</b> can prevent your computer from accessing more than a small number of remote hosts in quick succession. For example, if the game needs to ping multiple servers or regions to find out which one has the best connection. Server browsing in games like Counter Strike and TF2 ping thousands of servers. If your computer only shows a few servers when there should be hundreds or thousands, or if you experience network problems immediately after using the server browser in these games, then it's likely that you have a NAT problem.<br />  \t<br />  \tNAT problems are almost always caused by old home routers, and the solution is to buy a newer one.</li>  </ul>    <p>These problems are not mutually exclusive. Before reporting&nbsp;a problem, please take the time to try to identify what kind of problem(s) you have. When reporting a problem, provide data whenever possible: the symptoms you're experiencing, what your network configuration looks like, your ISP, what connectivity tests you have tried, etc. Problems reported without data are very difficult for us to help you with.</p>    <h2>Running a ping test</h2>    <p>Here's a simple but very useful diagnostic tool you can run to test network connectivity. First, you need to pick the host that you want to measure connectivity with. Usually this will be one of three options:</p>    <ul>  \t<li><b>A gameserver</b> you are trying to connect to. You'll need to find the IP address of the server you are actually talking to. Don't assume that you can just ping a domain name such as &quot;valve.com&quot; or &quot;dota2.com&quot;; those are web servers that don't have anything to do with gameplay. The exact method to find the IP address you are playing on differs by game. In most Valve games, you can open a console and the IP address of the server will be in there somewhere.<br />  \t<br />  \tIn some situations, you can run a test on an IP address that you have good reason to believe has equivalent network characteristics, if you don't know the IP address you are trying to talk to. For example, if you know the address of one of the gameservers in the US East region for a certain game, you might be able to use that IP address for a general test to all gameserves in US East. But only do this if you cannot get the exact IP address, and always share that information in any report, to make sure it doesn't invalidate any information you gather.</li>  \t<li><b>Your home router</b>. Communications problems to home routers are extremely common, especially over wireless networks. To find the address of your router, type &quot;ipconfig&quot; on Windows. Your router's address is the &quot;default gateway.&quot; It's very common for routers to have an address like &quot;192.168.0.x&quot; or &quot;10.0.0.x&quot;.</li>  \t<li><b>Some other major website</b>. Confirming connectivity with another site can help rule out general Internet connectivity problems. For these sites, you don't need a numeric IP address, you can use a domain name, such as &quot;amazon.com&quot;, &quot;google.com&quot;, &quot;facebook.com&quot;, &quot;netflix.com&quot;, etc.</li>  </ul>    <p>Once you have decided which computer you want to test connectivity to, follow these steps to run a basic ping test:</p>    <ol>  \t<li>Open up a command prompt.</li>  \t<li>On Windows, run the command: &quot;<span style=\"font-family: monospace\">ping -t <i>address</i></span>&quot;, replacing <span style=\"font-family: monospace\"><i>address</i></span> with the IP address or domain name you want to test.</li>  \t<li>Your computer will ping the given server repeatedly until you stop it with Ctrl+C.</li>  \t<li>Pay attention to how often the pings fail, and what the ping times are.</li>  </ol>    <p>Note that some hosts will block ping requests and will never reply to them. When this happens,&nbsp;you may see &quot;Request timed out&quot; instead of a ping response. If you experience this, you may need to try another host.</p>    <p>You can keep one or more of these tests running in the background while you play the game. This is especially helpful if the problem is intermittent. When the problem happens in game, switch over and examine what's happening to the ping test(s).</p>    <p>If ping is reporting lost packets, you may be able to narrow down where the problem is by running another tool:</p>    <ol>  \t<li>Open up a command prompt.</li>  \t<li>On Windows, run the command: &quot;<span style=\"font-family: monospace\">pathping&nbsp;<i>address</i></span>&quot;, replacing <span style=\"font-family: monospace\"><i>address</i></span> with the IP address or domain name you want to test.<br />  \tOn Linux, you can use the similar &quot;<code>mtr</code>&quot; command (you may need to install the &quot;mtr&quot; package to use it). For example: &quot;<code>mtr -n -c 100&nbsp;--report --report-wide <em>address</em></code>&quot;</li>  \t<li>Wait until the test finishes. It may take several minutes to complete.</li>  </ol>    <p>Pathping/MTR will report the latency for each hop&nbsp;your packets went through, as well as the loss at each hop. If a hop reports 100% packet loss but subsequent hosts do not, then it may be blocking ping requests and does not represent a network problem. If your first hop is reporting loss, then there is a problem between your computer and your router (wireless connections are often to blame for this).</p>    <h2>MTU problems</h2>    <p>If the ping test doesn't show any problems, but you are having connectivity issues with a game, it could be because of a difference between how ICMP packets (used by ping) are being handled compared to the type of packets (probably UDP) used by the game. One of the most common problems is that the game packets are larger than your maximum transmission unit (MTU). MTU is a measure of the size of packet that your network allows before either fragmenting it (which increases the chances of packet loss) or dropping it completely. MTU limitations could&nbsp;be present&nbsp;on your local network, or possibly somewhere further away, with your ISP.</p>    <p>On Windows, you can add &quot;<span style=\"font-family: monospace\">-l 1300</span>&quot; to force the ping test to use larger packets. If those pings stop working, then your home router or ISP might be enforcing a smaller MTU than the game expects.</p>    <h2>What information to share when reporting a network problem</h2>    <p>When communicating with Steam support or a <span class=\"bold SteamChinaExclude\">Valve</span><span class=\"bold SteamGlobalExclude\">Perfect World</span> employee, or just posting on a forum asking for help, your odds of getting help increase dramatically if you share the appropriate details. Here are the most important things to share:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>A detailed description of the problem. If you have a ping or packet loss readouts, share that. Is there any sort of error messages or console output? Share that. Also, always make sure that you share what you are actually seeing on your screen, not just your guess as to what the problem is.</li>  \t<li>Is the problem intermittent or pretty constant? If it happens only in certain circumstances, what are those circumstances?</li>  \t<li>If you know the IP, a &quot;trace route&quot; is <i>extremely</i> useful; always take the time to gather and share this information. It's really easy. On Windows, run &quot;<span style=\"font-family: monospace\">tracert <i>address</i></span>&quot; from a command prompt. On Linux, run &quot;<code>traceroute <em>address</em></code>&quot;&nbsp;Share the complete output.</li>  \t<li>Where are you in the world? What server are you trying to connect to? If you have the IP, share it. How did you decide that was the correct IP to use? If you only know the geographic region, share that. Network problems are EXTREMELY localized, if you do not describe where you are, you're unlikely to get help.</li>  \t<li>Describe your home network environment. Are you playing over wireless or wired? Are you in a dorm room? A house? Who else is using your network?</li>  \t<li>Who is your ISP?</li>  \t<li>If you have done ping or pathping tests, share those.&nbsp;Don't just share the result summaries. If possible, share the full output of the test.</li>  \t<li>What steps have you taken to confirm that the problem is not with your local network or ISP? Have you done the ping test with your router, and with another major web site? Are you consistently able to access other web sites?<br />  \t<br />  \tPlease note that while the inability to access these web sites is strong evidence that there's a local problem, the lack of such problems is NOT usually conclusive evidence that everything is working properly. Likewise, internet speed test results, bandwidth metrics, or the fact that you are on a fiber connection are typically just not relevant. Game traffic is significantly different from web traffic and is handled differently by your router and your ISP.</li>  \t<li>If you are posting on a forum where a <span class=\"bold SteamChinaExclude\">Valve</span><span class=\"bold SteamGlobalExclude\">Perfect World</span> employee might read it, make sure and share a link to your Steam community profile. This helps us locate your account, access recent matches, server connections, etc.</li>  </ul>",

Monochrome (one color) patterns are received as rank up drops and multi-colored patterns are received when purchasing a graffiti box. Both types of graffiti can be traded and sold on the Steam Market.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="graffitiuses">  <h3>How many times can I use a graffiti pattern?</h3>    <p>When a player unseals graffiti they can apply that pattern 50 times.

            '<h3>Valve Anti-Cheat Technology (VAC)</h3>  <p>Many games on Steam utilize the Valve Anti-Cheat System (VAC) or third party anti-cheat technology that can result in cheaters being banned from secure servers for multi-player games. VAC bans are permanent and cannot be removed from an account. If a VAC ban has been issued incorrectly it will automatically be rolled back by the VAC team.</p>  <p>You can learn more about Valve Anti-Cheat <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-Radz-6869">here</a>.</p>  &nbsp;    <h3>Game Bans</h3>  <p>Game Bans are used by game developers to address malicious behavior that falls outside of VAC detection. Game bans are determined by the game developer; they can range from single day bans to permanent bans.</p>   <p>You can learn more about Game Bans <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6899-IOSK-9514">here</a>.</p>  &nbsp;    <h3>How do VAC and Game Bans affect gifting?</h3>  <p>When a user is VAC or Game Banned, their Steam account is banned from playing multiplayer on secured servers. This creates an incentive for people who cheat to stockpile copies of games on one account and to gift them to low value accounts where they can continue cheating. In response to this problem, Steam no longer allows users to purchase copies of VAC or Game Ban enabled games to their inventory. Additionally, if an account has directly gifted a game to other players who have been VAC or permanently Game Banned, the gifter\'s account will lose the ability to gift that game moving forward.</p>  <p>We\'ve taken these steps to ensure the integrity of the multiplayer experience for those participating in online gaming communities. We understand that the restrictions on buying to your Inventory may be inconvenient, but we believe these steps will reduce the number of cheaters you\'ll play against.</p>',

For example, we are unable to ship to Isle of Man, Réunion, the Canary Islands, or Puerto Rico.</p>  \t  <h4>Are there any restrictions to how many pieces of Hardware I can purchase at once?</h4>  \t<p>You will be able to purchase multiples of some items, but not others. This will be indicated to you during the purchase process. As an example, you will be able to purchase multiple base stations within one cart purchase, but only one headset.</p>  \t  <h4>Will my Hardware be shipped together?</h4>  \t<p>Due to the size differences between products, it is possible that your shipment will be in multiple packages. If it is, don’t worry - they will be shipped at the same time and all be tied to the same master tracking number.</p>    <h4>How do I refund or replace my Hardware?</h4>  \t<p>Look for detailed instructions on returning Hardware in our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7013-OXBM-2746">RMA Guide.</a></p>  \t<p>More information on returning or replacing individually purchased pieces of accessories can be found <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithHardwareAccessory">here.</a></p>  \t<p>If you’ve already returned your hardware and you want to know the return’s status, or the refund has not been processed within three weeks of the return date, please Contact <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamHardware">Hardware Support.</a></p>    <h4>What happens if my order can’t be delivered?</h4>  \t<p>When the carrier is unable to deliver an order, it is returned to our shipping warehouse. All charges, including shipping, are automatically refunded back to the original payment method.</p>  \t<p>Undeliverable orders cannot be shipped again; instead, you will need to re-order the products.</p>  \t<p>Note: You will be charged the price that is posted on the Steam Store at the time of your purchase. If you previously purchased Hardware during a sale and the product is returned, that same discount cannot be applied if the discount period has expired. Likewise, Hardware Support is unable to apply discounts from previous sales.</p>    <h4>What if my order is lost in-transit or stolen?</h4>  \t<p>Please contact <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamHardware">Hardware Support</a> to report any lost or stolen device orders.</p>    <h4>My package is held at a ParcelShop (EU only)</h4>  \t<p>For Hardware orders made through the Steam Store in the European Union:</p>  \t<p>If you have not received your shipment it may be stored at a GLS depot (ParcelShop). This happens if the carrier cannot locate your address or no one was present to sign and accept the delivery. When a shipment is held at a ParcelShop, it will not be re-delivered.

            '<p><a name="supportedformats"></a></p>    <h3>Steam Remote Play Audio Support</h3>    <p>Steam supports streaming stereo (2 channel) audio from all streaming host operating systems to all streaming clients (including the Steam Link). Steam Clients running on Windows can also stream quadraphonic (4 channel) and 5.1 surround sound (6 channel) audio to all streaming clients.</p>    <p><a name="channelconfig"></a></p>    <h3>Speaker Configuration</h3>    <p>Steam will try to automatically detect how many speakers are connected to the streaming client\'s computer or TV. You can view how many speakers Steam detected and choose a different configuration by:</p>    <ul>  \t<li><b>Steam Link</b>: Before connecting to your host machine, select Settings -&gt; Audio -&gt; Speaker Configuration</li>  \t<li><b>Steam Client</b>: Select Steam menu -&gt; Remote Play -&gt; Advanced Client Options -&gt; Speaker Configuration</li>  </ul>    <p><a name="what51audio"></a></p>    <h3>What 5.1 audio can Steam record?</h3>    <p>Steam currently only records 5.1 audio from processes launched through Steam on Windows. Other host system audio will be mixed with audio recorded from the game process as stereo audio.</p>    <p><a name="51audiolinux"></a></p>    <h3>Is 5.1 audio supported when streaming to a Linux or OSX client?</h3>    <p>Yes, however you will need to go into the Remote Play settings and select your speaker configuration manually.</p>    <p><a name="51tv"></a></p>    <h3>Requirements for 5.1 audio on TV</h3>    <p>The Steam Client and Steam Link output 6 channel PCM audio when configured for 5.1 surround sound audio. When connected to a TV, the TV or audio receiver need to support 6 channel PCM. Please refer to your device\'s user manual to check if your device supports this format. It is usually required to use an HDMI cable to connect to your Steam Link, instead of an optical cable, to enable PCM support.</p>    <p><a name="additionalsupport"></a></p>    <h3>Need additional support?</h3>    <p>The <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions">Steam Remote Play discussion forum</a> contains many posts by community members that can be useful when debugging specific streaming issues and the forum can be used to ask specific questions about your streaming setup.

If you are connected to your onboard display adapter, you will see an Intel HD Graphics device listed in your SteamVR system report. Onboard cards, such as those connected to a PC’s motherboard, will not be powerful enough to use the Vive. Reconnect your Vive to your PC’s dedicated graphics card.</li>  \t<li>Check to make sure you are in Direct Mode by going to Settings > Developer > Direct Mode. Click the button that says “Enable Direct Mode.” SteamVR will restart with this setting.</li>  \t<li>If Direct Mode is not enabled, SteamVR will still work in Extended mode. For this to work correctly, make sure your displays are extended in Windows &gt; Display Settings.</li>  \t<li>Make sure all cables are connected firmly. The power cord on the HMD itself can become loose from usage. To check this, remove the cable panel on top of the HMD by pushing it forward.</li>  \t<li>Make sure your Link Box is installed in the correct direction. The orange tipped cables from the Headset should be connected to the orange ports on the Link Box.</li>  \t<li>Check to make sure you have the latest video drivers.</li>  </ul>  </div>  </div>  </div>    <div class="content-hover-section">  <div class="troubleshooting_step_container">  <div class="troubleshooting_header_container">  <h2 class="troubleshooting-header">Headset not detected</h2>    <div class="triangle-toggle">&nbsp;</div>  </div>    <div class="troubleshooting-collapse collapse">  <ul>  \t<li>Make sure the headset is properly plugged in.</li>  \t<li>The end of your Headset&#39;s tether has three orange tipped cords (USB, HDMI, and Power).

Open your Frame Timing graph (SteamVR &gt; Settings &gt; Performance &gt; &ldquo;Display Frame Timing&rdquo;) and look for frame timing spikes. If you see spikes, the issue is most likely with CPU performance, and not with tracking.</p>  &nbsp;    <p>If a device&#39;s icon in SteamVR Status is pulsing green, it means it is not tracking. When in-headset the displays go grey when your headset loses tracking. Check the following if you are having tracking issues:</p>  &nbsp;    <ul>  \t<li>Make sure your base stations are set up correctly. They should be above head height (at least 6.5 feet), angled down 30-45 degrees, and no further than 5 meters, or 16 feet, apart.</li>  \t<li>Check to make sure your devices are in view of at least one base station, and your bases are powered and synced. Their LEDs should be green if everything is good. See the Base Stations section above for more information about syncing.</li>  \t<li>Loose cable connections can also cause tracking issues. Make sure all connections at the headset, link box, and PC are secure.</li>  \t<li>While most issues caused by reflective surfaces have been solved, in some situations they can still cause tracking issues. If you are losing tracking or motion controllers occasionally float away in VR, try covering reflective surfaces in your VR area.</li>  \t<li>Turning on the front-facing camera can sometimes cause tracking issues. If you lose tracking every time you bring up your dashboard, your camera may be at fault. Try lowering the camera bandwidth in SteamVR &gt; Settings &gt; Camera, or disabling the front-facing camera.</li>  </ul>  </div>  </div>    <div class="content-section">  <div id="steamvr-issues">  <h4>SteamVR Issues (Error 301)</h4>    <p>If you are experiencing problems with missing or corrupt files in SteamVR or you are encountering an Error 301, make sure the SteamVR tool is correctly installed by verifying the tool cache.</p>  &nbsp;    <ol>  \t<li>Quit SteamVR and go to the Steam Client.</li>  \t<li>Find SteamVR under Library &gt; Tools.</li>  \t<li>Right click on SteamVR and select Properties.

We have transitioned to using the FBX format for better functionality within our pipeline and better compatibility with most commercial modeling and animation software. We found <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=10775847">Autodesk&#39;s FBX SDK</a> very helpful when we were transitioning our tools to&nbsp;FBX and we&nbsp;highly recommend this resource (which includes a Python SDK)&nbsp;to other modeling software developers.</span></span></li>  </ul>    <p style="text-align: justify;"><a id="refmodel" name="refmodel"></a></p>    <h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">My model mesh has broken skinning, is the wrong scale, or is completely detached from the skeleton when I preview it in the workshop tool.</span></span></strong></h2>    <ul>  \t<li>  \t<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Valve reference file.</strong>&nbsp;Are you weighting meshes to a current Valve&nbsp;reference file? Old Valve model files, files from other sources or decompiled game files&nbsp;may contain incorrect scaling or inaccurate joint positions. You can download Valve&#39;s latest model files from&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.dota2.com/workshop/requirements">Hero Resource</a> page.</span></span></p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Import and Export with Scale Factor set to 1.0</strong>. Our workshop tools don&#39;t use a set unit of measurement. However, when you import&nbsp;our&nbsp;workshop reference files or export your item files, it is important to ensure that&nbsp;your importer and exporter do not apply a scale factor other than 1.0. The scale factor can be viewed in your software&#39;s import and export&nbsp;settings. You should confirm the correct scale settings before importing any Valve workshop file.</span></span></p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Bone renaming.</strong> If you see a compile error saying bones have not been found, check to see if&nbsp;your reference file import or authoring process, such as adding a rig,&nbsp;caused the bones of our default skeleton to become renamed.</span></span></p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Include the root bone. </strong>Export your mesh file with the root bone included.&nbsp;Some exporters may decide to ignore the root if it is not part of the skinning, to avoid that you can add the root bone to the skin with 0 influence.</span></span></p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Altered joint positions.</strong> Did you reposition the joints of Valve&#39;s default hero skeleton before authoring your item? Community hero wearable items, including mounts,&nbsp;must work with Valve&#39;s default hero&nbsp;joint positions and animations.</span></span></p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Mesh shape is incompatible with animated joints.</strong>&nbsp;Is your mesh&nbsp;drastically different from the default hero skeleton in an area that has many highly active joints, such as wings? If your mesh distorts too much during animations you may have to revise the mesh to more closely follow the skeleton.</span></span></p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Valve cloth.</strong> If you are authoring something that uses Valve&#39;s cloth, such as Zeus&#39; scarf or Crystal Maiden&#39;s cape,&nbsp;study the skinning&nbsp;on Valve&#39;s hero reference file and copy it if necessary. Source 2 cloth requires very careful weighting.</span></span></p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Static model&nbsp;export pose.</strong> Have you accidentally exported your model on an action pose or a range of animation? You&#39;ll need&nbsp;to export your model as a single, static frame of the skeleton&#39;s bind pose. If your item is skinned to a Valve skeleton, the joints must match the scale, positions and rotations of Valve&#39;s bind pose.</span></span></p>  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>4 Vertex skinning limit. </strong>Our game&nbsp;is only able to support the skinning of 4 vertices per joint.

In addition, there are several tools online that can approximate your IPD via webcam.</p>  <p>The average adult male IPD is ~65mm, and the average adult female IPD is ~63mm. When others are playing your Vive, make sure you set the IPD to something closer to these means.</p>    <br>  <br>    <p><h3><strong>What if my IPD is not set correctly, or is out of the adjustable range of the HTC Vive?</strong></h3>  <p>The HTC Vive headset\'s can be adjusted to fit customer IPDs across a broad range of values. That being said, we have tested with IPDs that are 5mm off, and things still look good. There will be a bit of softer focus on the extreme edge of the image on one side, but the lenses will still produce a clear image with rock solid geometry (no warping). </p>  <p>In our demo setups we usually set the IPD near the median IPD ~64mm and use that IPD for everyone who gets a demo.  The difference in performance is not dramatic, but if you know what to look for you can see a slight difference.  Even an IPD offset of 8-10mm still looks quite good.</p>  <p>What you will see if the lens is not centered is an increase in stray light. The worst case scenario is looking at white text on a dark background.  In that case, you will see stray light halos in the dark area around the white text.  In games without sharp contrast boundaries the stray light will be difficult to see.</p>    <br>  <br>    <p><h3><strong>I have a question about my HTC Vive order / shipping / billing.</strong></h3>  <p>Please visit <a href="https://www.htcvive.com/us/support" target="_blank">HTC Vive Support</a> for anything related to HTC Vive orders, shipping, and billing.</p>    <br>  <br>    <p><h3><strong>Can I use my Oculus Rift with SteamVR?</strong></h3>  <p>Yes, SteamVR supports the Oculus Rift. When using the Rift with SteamVR, use the Back button on an Xbox controller to bring up and dismiss the SteamVR Dashboard.

            '<div class="section" id="gsltinfo">  <h3>What is a GSLT ban?</h3>    <p>GSLT (Game Server Login Token) bans are issued to server operators offering false inventories and/or profiles as a free or paid service via mods on their servers. These mods inaccurately report the contents of a player&rsquo;s inventory and/or matchmaking status, devaluing both and potentially creating a confusing experience for players.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="receiveban">  <h3>What happens if I receive a GSLT ban?</h3>    <p>Server operators receiving a GSLT ban will receive the following in-game message:</p>    <ul>  \t<li><strong>A server using your game server login token has been banned. Your account is now permanently banned from operating game servers, and you have a cooldown from connecting to game servers.</strong></li>  </ul>    <p>Players receiving this message are permanently banned from operating community servers in CS:GO and will receive a matchmaking cooldown. The matchmaking cooldown for GSLT bans restricts users from playing CS:GO matches and trading in-game items for the duration of the cooldown. For more information about cooldowns, please see our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1203-WJCV-7019">competitive cooldowns and bans FAQ</a>.</p>    <p>Players wanting to host servers in the future will need to use a Steam account that has never shared a phone number with a GSLT banned account and re-purchase CS:GO.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="dontoffer">  <h3>What should not be offered on community servers?</h3>    <p>If a server provides any of the following services we ask that you disable them:</p>    <ul>  \t<li>Services allowing players to claim temporary ownership of CS:GO items that are not in their inventory (weapon skins, knives, etc.).</li>  \t<li>Services providing a falsified competitive skill group and/or profile rank status or scoreboard coin (Operation Challenge Coins).</li>  \t<li>Services that interfere with a player\'s ability to correctly access their CS:GO inventories, items, or profile.</li>  </ul>  </div>    <div class="section" id="tradegslt">  <h3>Am I able to trade CS:GO items if I\'ve received a GSLT ban?</h3>    <p>Players that have been GSLT banned also receive a matchmaking cooldown and are unable to trade for the duration of their cooldown.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="customknife">  <h3>My server provides custom knives to users. Is this OK?</h3>    <p>No. Servers that provide custom knives, like \'vanilla\' Karambit or Bayonet knives, are generating/simulating items that are not owned by a player and may result in a GSLT ban.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="onlyplayer">  <h3>My server changes the way a weapon appears in-game only to the player using the weapon. Is this OK?</h3>    <p>No. Regardless of who can see the items, mods should not generate/simulate items that are not owned by a player. Offering these mods may result in a GSLT ban.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="stockweapons">  <h3>My server grants stock primary/secondary weapons and grenades to players through a gun selection menu, but not knives. Is this OK?</h3>    <p>Yes, it&rsquo;s fine to provide basic stock weapons to players via a mod.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="scoreboard">  <h3>My server doesn&rsquo;t spoof competitive ranks or coins, but does adjust the scoreboard. Is this OK?</h3>    <p>Yes, it&rsquo;s fine to offer a mod that modifies scores or player names in the scoreboard. These mods typically exist on surf servers where group tags represent skill rating, score is your rank on the server, MVP is your completion percentage, etc.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="removehide">  <h3>My server allows users to &ldquo;remove all weapons&rdquo;/&ldquo;hide knife&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;knife drop&rdquo;/&ldquo;knife switch&rdquo;. Is this OK?</h3>    <p>As long as the mod is not granting an item that a player does not own, these mods are OK to offer. There are some game modes where it makes sense to have unarmed players, like surfing and trading servers where players give items to each other to inspect.</p>    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If a game server is allowing players to drop their knives, no additional plugins should be required if the server runs with a built-in &ldquo;mp_drop_knife_enable 1&rdquo; setting.</p>  </div>',

            '<div class="section" id="skillgroup">  <h3>What are competitive skill groups?</h3>    <p>Like an Elo rating in Chess, CS:GO competitive skill groups predict how well players will perform when playing against other players. Two equally skilled teams should, on average, win an equal number of matches when competing against each other.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="ranklist">  <h3>What are all of the competitive skill groups?</h3>    <p>In the image below, CS:GO skill groups are arranged from lowest skill group in the upper left (Silver I), to highest skill group in the lower right (Global Elite):</p>    <center><img alt="ranklist" src="http://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/support/csgo/rank_2018.jpg" style="PADDING-TOP: 10px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 15px" /></center>  </div>    <div class="section" id="displayrank">  <h3>Where is my skill group displayed in-game?</h3>    <p>Once a player has been assigned a skill group, it will be displayed in the main menu, in party lobbies, and in the match scoreboard next to their name. Players sharing a lobby will have their skill group displayed at all times.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="norank">  <h3>Why don\'t I have a skill group?</h3>    <p>New players will not immediately have a skill group because it has not been calibrated yet. A skill group will be assigned to a new player after they have won ten games.</p>    <p>When new players play their first game, we have no idea what their skill level is. As they play more games, we use those wins and losses to make predictions about what skill group we think they should be in. The more games they play, the more confident the system is in predicting who the other players are that they should be playing against. Winning 10 games gives us enough data to confidently place new players in a skill group where we think they will be matched up with others of the same skill level.</p>    <p>If a player has taken an extended break from the game, their skill group may not be visible until it has been recalibrated after one win.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="lostrank">  <h3>Why have I suddenly lost my skill group?</h3>    <p>If one or more members of your recent competitive parties were permanently banned for cheating, your competitive wins and skill group may have been adjusted to reflect this. CS:GO skill groups are calculated and adjusted automatically and cannot be modified.</p>    <p>Another reason your skill group may no longer be visible is because of inactivity. If you have taken an extended break from Competitive matchmaking we are less confident in where you fit into the current skill groups. If you previously had a skill group and it no longer shows, you will need to win one Competitive match to have your skill group reassessed and issued.</p>    </div>    <div class="section" id="withfriends">  <h3>Should I avoid partying up with lower skilled friends? Will this affect my skill group?</h3>    <p>No. The matchmaking system will take your lower-skilled friend into consideration when finding a match. Additionally, the system makes a prediction about how well each team member will perform in a match, so losing a match with a lower skilled player on your team is not likely to significantly impact your skill group. If you always play your best, your skill group will provide you with well matched teammates and opponents.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="whycomp">  <h3>I&rsquo;m not a very good player. Should I still use competitive matchmaking?</h3>    <p>Yes! Competitive matchmaking will match you with other players of similar skill, which is more likely to increase your overall skill and result in a fun match.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="diffrank">  <h3>How is my competitive skill group different than my profile rank?</h3>    <p>Your competitive skill group is calibrated and assigned through competitive matchmaking <i>only</i> and may increase and decrease based on your match results.</p>    <p>Your CS:GO profile rank is displayed above your competitive skill group and increases through match XP. Match XP is earned in both casual and competitive matchmaking and is earned after the match has concluded. Max profile rank is 40.</p>    <p>Players electing to receive a Service Medal will have their profile reset to rank 1. Receiving a Service Medal will not affect a player\'s competitive skill group or <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2235-QYCN-3295" title="Prime Matchmaking">Prime Matchmaking</a> eligibility.</p>  </div>',

            '<div class="section" id="tfmm">  <h3>What factors are considered in Trust Factor matchmaking?</h3>  <p>At this time we are not providing the list of factors used in the Trust Factor matchmaking system. We don’t want players to have to worry about any particular action while they’re playing CS:GO or other games on Steam. Additionally, Trust Factor matchmaking will get continuous updates, and any list of factors would become outdated very quickly. In general, Trust Factor is determined by looking at a user\'s past experience in CS:GO and on Steam to ensure the system is as accurate as possible.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="tfcheck">  <h3>Can I check my Trust Factor?</h3>  <p>Currently there is no way to check your Trust Factor. The goal with Trust Factor is to provide a better matchmaking experience without players having to worry about optimizing anything. Trust Factor matchmaking will try to match similar players, but like skill groups, the range of players on a server will vary depending on the time of day, the player\'s region, and the maps they are queuing for.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="tfwarning">  <h3>I am being shown a warning before queueing with a player. What does this mean?</h3>  <p>Before beginning a Competitive match, players with Prime status on their account will be told if a member of their lobby (who is also opted into Prime) will affect their matchmaking experience due to their Trust Factor. This message will only show to players who have Prime status and will only show for players who are also opted into Prime. The two messages you may receive are:</p>   <ul>  <li><p><i>Your matchmaking experience may be slightly impacted because Trust Factor of (player) is lower than yours.</i></p></li>  <li><p><i>Your matchmaking experience will be significantly affected because Trust Factor of (player) is substantially lower than yours.</i></p></li>  </ul>  <p>Either of these messages indicate a player in your lobby has lower trust score than you and may negatively affect the quality of your match. As a player\'s Trust Factor improves this message will show to fewer users.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="tfimprove">  <h3>What can I do to improve my Trust Factor?</h3>  <p>The only way to improve your Trust Factor is to be a positive member of the CS:GO and Steam community. Trust Factor matchmaking will continue to be adjusted, but all players have to do to improve their matchmaking experience is continue playing CS:GO and other Steam games legitimately. The more a user plays, the more information the system has and the easier it will be for the system to determine who they should be matched with.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="tfprime">  <h3>Does Prime status improve my Trust Factor?</h3>  <p>Yes. Phone numbers and CS:GO Rank are among the factors used in the new Trust Factor matchmaking system. Users who had Prime Status before will benefit from this and their in-game experience. If you have not linked your Steam account with a phone number for Prime we encourage you to do this; doing so will improve your matchmaking experience.</p>  <p>For more information, please see our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2235-QYCN-3295">Prime Account Matchmaking</a> help article.  </div>    <div class="section" id="tfnewplayer">  <h3>Will new players have a low Trust Factor?</h3>  <p>Not necessarily. Trust Factor is impacted by a user\'s experiences on Steam and in CS:GO. If you have been a positive member of the Steam Community in the past, you will likely enter CS:GO with a high Trust Factor.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="tfpoormatch">  <h3>I suspect that I have a low Trust Factor because the quality of my matches is poor. What can I do about this?</h3>  <p>If you feel like your matches are poor because of Trust Factor, feel free to send an email to the address below with the subject “Trust Factor Feedback”:</p>  <p><i>CSGOTeamFeedback@valvesoftware.com</i></p>  <p>Please include a description of your experience and your Steam ID so we can investigate; this will help us improve Trust Factor matchmaking going forward.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="tfpoorfriend">  <h3>I suspect that my friend has a low Trust Factor because of the quality of my matches when, and only when, I party up with them. What can I do about this?</h3>  <p>In these situations we recommend you have your friend (who you believe to have the lowest Trust Factor) email us at the address previously provided with their Steam ID and information. Be aware that when players are in a party, we use the lowest Trust Factor of any individual in the party for matchmaking purposes.</p>  <p>If you and your friend are opted into Prime Matchmaking you may be told the quality of your match will be affected if their Trust Factor is significantly lower than yours. You may still queue with this user, but with the understanding that the quality of your match may degrade since their Trust Factor is significantly lower.</p>  </div>',

Please review the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9828-SFLZ-9289">Programs Which May Interfere with Steam</a> article.</p>  \t\t\t<p>Alternatively, from the Steam Link main menu, highlight your host computer, then press the "Y" button to start the network test. This test will start Big Picture on your host computer and simulate 10 seconds of network traffic with your current network settings. </p>  \t\t\t<p>The test will also inform you if there are any issues with ports. If you see any errors, make sure your <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8571-GLVN-8711">ports are appropriately configured for Steam.</a></p>  \t\t\t  \t\t<h4>The game is choppy and unresponsive. How can I improve the experience?</h4>  \t\t\t<p>We recommend using wired connection for best experience. For wireless connection, the majority of people have found that switching to a 5GHz network significantly improves the gaming experience.</p>  \t\t\t<p>Alternatively, you can switch to the ‘Fast’ streaming quality option from the Streaming settings in the Steam Link. </p>  \t\t\t  \t\t<h4>How can I pair multiple controllers to my Steam Link?</h4>  \t\t\t<p>You can pair a Steam Controller to your wireless receiver or directly to the Steam Link. To pair a Steam Controller directly to the Link, remove all USB peripherals from the Steam Link, boot to the blue pairing screen, and power-on the Steam Controller by holding "X" with the Steam/Home button. You can repeat these steps for pairing additional controllers.</p>   \t\t\t<p>To toggle between pairing modes (the wireless receiver or Steam Link), press the Steam button while holding "A".</p>  \t\t\t  \t\t<h4>How can I play non-Steam games on the Steam Link?</h4>  \t\t\t<p>The Steam Link can stream any computer game once you add it to your Steam library. Retail games and non-Steam games can be added to your Steam library from the Steam client by clicking “+ ADD A GAME”. You should launch the game from Steam, rather than using a shortcut on your desktop.</p>  </div>\t    <div class="button-section" id="button2-section">  \t<div align="center" class="note">  \t\t<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>  \t</div>\t    \t<h4>Experiencing Performance Issues?</h4>  \t\t<p>If you are experiencing performance issues please ensure that your <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4950-EBNM-7843">settings are optimized for Streaming.</a></p>  \t\t\t\t  \t<h4>Contacting Steam Support</h4>  \t\t<p>If you have other issues or questions, contact <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGameIssue/?appid=353380&issueid=354&nodeid=1&return_nodeid=9">Steam Support</a> and attach the <em><font color="white">remote_connections.txt</font></em> and <em><font color="white">streaming_log.txt</em></font> files to your ticket.</p>  \t\t<p>The default location for this file on your PC is <em><font color="white">C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\logs</font></em></p>\t\t\t\t  </div>    <div align="center">  <br><hr><br>  \t<h1>Support Resources</h1>  \t<div class="row">  \t    \t\t<div class="column">  \t\t  \t<a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=108>  \t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_faq.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t\t    <p><font color=white>View other FAQs</font></p>  \t\t  \t</a>  \t\t </div>  \t    \t <div class="column">  \t  \t<a href=http://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions>  \t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_developer.png" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t    <p><font color=white>Visit the community Forums</font></p>  \t\t</a>  \t </div>  \t    \t  <div class="column">  \t\t<a href=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGameIssue/?appid=353380&issueid=354&nodeid=1&return_nodeid=9>\t    \t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_steam.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">   \t    <p><font color=white>Contact Steam Support</font></p>  \t\t</a>\t  \t  </div>  </div>        <p>  <style class="link-streaming-css" type="text/css">html {  \t\tbox-sizing: border-box;  \t}  \t  \t.row:after {  \t    content: "";  \t    display: table;  \t    clear: both;  \t}\t  \t  \tul {    \t\tpadding-left: 10px;  \t}  \t  \tol {    \t\tpadding-left: 10px;  \t}    \t.column {  \t    float: left;  \t\t width: 33.33%;  \t    padding: 10px;  \t}    </style>  </p>  \t  <script type="text/javascript">    \t\tvar headerImage = $("<img/>", {  \t\t\tsrc: "https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_link/SteamLink_Support_Header01.png",  \t\t\tcss: {height: "280px", width: "100%"},  \t\t});    \t\t$(".container").css({"background": "url(https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_universe/bg.jpg) 0px 0px / 100% 6000px no-repeat", "width": "950px", "display": "inline-block"});  \t\t$("#contain_nav_search").after(headerImage);          var nver = window.navigator.appVersion;      if (nver.indexOf("NA") != -1) {          $("#button1").addClass("active-button");          $(".button-section").hide();          $("#button1-section").show();      } else if (nver.indexOf("LAN") != -1) {          $("#button2").addClass("active-button");          $(".button-section").hide();          $("#button2-section").show();        } else {          $("#button1").addClass("active-button");          $("#button1-section").show();      }        $(".ui-button").click(function (clicked) {          var clickedEl = $(this).attr("id");          $(".active-button").removeClass("active-button");          $(this).addClass("active-button");          $(".button-section").hide();          $("#"+clickedEl+"-section").show();      });    </script>',

This means that after that date the Steam Client will no longer run on those versions of Windows. In order to continue running Steam and any games or other products purchased through Steam, users will need to update to a more recent version of Windows.</p>    <p>The newest features in Steam rely on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older versions of Windows. In addition, future versions of Steam will require Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows 7 and above.</p>    <p>For the remainder of 2018 Steam will continue to run and to launch games on Windows XP and Windows Vista, but other functionality in Steam will be somewhat limited. For example, new features such as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/updates/chatupdate">the new Steam Chat</a> will not be available. We encourage all users on these operating systems to upgrade to newer versions of Windows in order to have ongoing access to the latest features of Steam, and to ensure future access to all games and other Steam content.</p>',

The following instructions will walk you through the setup of the Steam PC Café Server. Additional information about the program can be found <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3303-QWRC-3436" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>    <h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:29px;"><strong>Setup Instructions</strong></span></h1><br>    <li>Visit the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com" target="blank">Steamworks website</a> and login with your Steam master account credentials. That\'s the account you signed up with and registered as a licensee of the PC Café Program.</li>  <p></p>  <li>Download the Steam PC Café Server file by clicking the link located under the "Tools + Links" section on the right.</li>  <p></p>  <li>Unzip the server files to your hard drive.</li>  <p></p>  <li>Create a new Steam account <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/join/" target="_blank">here</a> that will be used at the individual location as a server account. If you have multiple physical locations, you will need one Steam Server account per location.</li>  <p></p>  <li>Once the account has been created, go back to the Steamworks website (make sure you\'re logged in with your Steam master account), navigate to the "Users & Permissions" menu option and select "Manage Users". On this page click the "Add User" button and fill in the required information about the Steam server account you\'ve just created. Don\'t give it any special permissions.</li>  <p></p>  <li>Go to the "Manage Sites" page and add a new Café location. The name you select here will also be displayed in the Steam client library of your patrons. Once the new location has been added, move the mouse cursor over the new location entry. You should see a key symbol appear under the "Server Account" section. Click on the key and select the Steam server account you just added. Repeat this step if you have multiple locations.</li>  <p></p>    <p>Once you have completed the above setup, it’s time to run the server in your local network.</p>    <li><p>Navigate to the folder that the server files have been extracted to and double click steamcmd.exe, enter the Steam account credentials of your Steam Server account for the location. You can double check what account has been assigned to the location <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/sitelicense/editsites/" target="_blank">here</a> with your master account.</p></li>    <li><p>The first time you\'re launching the server on a new machine, you will need to enter the Steam Guard code that will be sent to the email address associated with the Steam Server account.</p></li>      <p></p>  <p></p>    <h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:36px;"><strong>Content Cache</strong></span></h1>    <p>The content cache allows you to download game files once and then distribute them through your local network to the individual game stations. Patrons that bring their own computer or laptop can also access the game files instead of using your location\'s Internet bandwidth. Please note that the game files will be saved on your server machine and you may need to increase your hard drive space depending on the amount of games that you will offer.</p>    <h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:29px;"><strong>Configuration</strong></span></h1><br>    <p>To enable the content cache or make any changes, go to "Settings" and select "Content Cache" from the drop down menu.</p>    <img src="http://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/support/sitelp/settings.png" alt="server settings">     <p></p>  <p>When a game is launched for the first time in your network, the download request will be sent to the server machine. If the game files are not cached on the server yet, the server will download them automatically, cache them, and return them to the client machine. If the game content cache is already available on your server, the server will automatically send the files to the client machine.</p>          <script>  var coll = document.getElementsByClassName("collapsible");  var i;    for (i = 0; i < coll.length; i++) {      coll[i].addEventListener("click", function() {          this.classList.toggle("active");          var content = this.nextElementSibling;          if (content.style.display === "block") {              content.style.display = "none";          } else {              content.style.display = "block";          }      });  }  </script>    </body>  </html>      <p></p>  <p></p>  <div id="wrapperHeader">      <div id="header">               <img src="http://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/support/sitelp/FAQ2_SteamLogo_Banner.png" width="100%" height="320px" alt="logo" />      </div>   </div>      <div class="content-hover-section">  \t<div class="troubleshooting_step_container">  \t<div class="troubleshooting_header_container">  \t\t<h2 class="troubleshooting-header">Are there any special requirements for the type of hardware I use for the Steam PC Café Server?</h2>    \t\t<div class="triangle-toggle">&nbsp;</div>  \t\t</div>    \t<div class="troubleshooting-collapse collapse">&nbsp;  \t\t<p>To run a Steam PC Café Server, you just need a secure Windows 7 or Windows 10 PC connected to the location\'s network.

If no server account has been assigned yet, a server account must be added to the license agreement first, by clicking the "Manage Users" option on the Steamworks page. Once added, you will be able to assign it to a site location. A server account is basically a Steam account that does not own anything.</p></div>  \t</div>  </div>    <div class="content-hover-section">  \t<div class="troubleshooting_step_container">  \t<div class="troubleshooting_header_container">  \t\t<h2 class="troubleshooting-header">What ports are being used by the Steam PC Café Server?</h2>    \t\t<div class="triangle-toggle">&nbsp;</div>  \t\t</div>    \t<div class="troubleshooting-collapse collapse">&nbsp;  \t\t<p>The Steam PC Café Server uses UDP broadcast packets over port 27036 to announce itself to Steam clients on the network.

            "<ul>  <li>Harassment or stalking</li>  <li>Spamming invites, links or advertisements</li>  <li>Attempting to scam items or personal info</li>  <li>Attempting account theft or phishing</li>  </ul>  <p>Several options are available to address abusive behaviors encountered while using Steam. There are also practices to keep in mind that can help you avoid these types of behaviors altogether.</p>  <p>If you are ever experiencing abuse outside of Steam, or if you ever feel that your safety is being threatened, we strongly encourage contacting local emergency or law enforcement services in your area.</p>",
            '<h4>What Options Are Available?</h4>   <p>  There are different ways to address negative behavior from other players. You\'ll want to use the options that make the most sense for your situation. We are always interested in hearing about your experience, so if an option is missing, let us know.</p>  <ul>  <li><h5>Reporting Content</h5>  <p>If another player is hosting content that is being used in an abusive or inappropriate manner, we encourage players to utilize our reporting system. Reports are reviewed and typically resolved within 24 hours of submission. You will receive a notification if action is taken.</p>  <p><a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1476-HJCM-5616">Reporting content within the Steam Community</a></p></li>    <li><h5>Remove Friend</h5>  <p>If you are Steam friends with the other player, you always have the option of ending that relationship. Unfriending will remove the ability for the other player to contact you via Steam, It will also prevent them from viewing any content that you have set to private, or friends only.</p>  <p>To unfriend someone, navigate to their profile and select the <i>unfriend</i> option under the <i>more</i> dropdown. Alternatively, you can use the dropdown next to their profile name in your friends list, selecting the <i>manage</i> option.</p></li>    <li><h5>Block Communication</h5>  <p>Blocking another player on Steam will prevent them from interacting with you in the following ways:</p>  <ul>  <li>Sending you friend or group invites</li>  <li>Sending messages to you through Steam chat</li>  <li>Commenting on your profile or community items that you\'ve created</li>  </ul>  <p>To block another player, navigate to their profile and select the <i>block all communication</i> option under the <i>more</i> dropdown. Alternatively, you can block players from your friends list, or from your pending invites list.</p></li>  <li><h5>Enable Chat Filtering</h5>  <p>Steam Chat Filtering allows you to control the type of content that can be seen in Steam and in-game chats. You can also customize the filtration in a number of ways.</p>  <p>To learn more about this feature and opt-in, visit your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/preferences/#CommunityContentPreferences">account preferences</a> page.</p>    <li><h5>Adjusting Privacy Options</h5>  <p>You can adjust privacy options to manage who can view specific components of your profile, who can comment on it, as well as who can view your inventory.</p>  <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings">View Your Privacy Options</a></p></li>    <li><h5>Invisible Mode</h5>  <p>You can set your Steam status to Invisible, which will cause you to appear offline to other users. You’ll still be able to view your friends list, send and receive messages and otherwise participate in the community. However, other players won\'t know you are online. You can set this status from your Steam Friends list next to your profile avatar.</p></li>    <li><h5>Claiming Copyright Infringement</h5>  <p>Anyone who believes that their work has been reproduced in one of our internet sites or services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement may notify Valve\'s copyright agent using the form below.</p>  <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/dmca/create/">Notice of Copyright Infringement</a></li>    <li><h5>In-game Resources</h5>  <p>Many games feature in-game reporting systems designed to mitigate player abuse within that game\'s community. Players are encouraged to utilize these systems and submit information via in-game reports.</p></li>    <li><h5>Contact Your Local Authorities</h5>  <p>You can use all of these features to manage negative behavior within the community, but if you ever feel that you are in danger, we strongly encourage you to contact law enforcement in your area.</p></li>  </ul>    <h4>Best Practices</h4>  <p>We always recommend that players engage in responsible behavior while using Steam. Doing so will decrease the likelihood of your account being the target of malicious activities.</p>  <ul>  <li><h5>Keep Your Personal Info Safe</h5>  <p>Many different types of malicious activity rely on access to your personal information. Never post personally identifiable information on Steam, even in private chats or other areas that you might think are safe. Someone else can always decide to make this content public.</p>  <p>You should also review your Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/my/edit/settings">privacy options</a> and be aware of what components of your profile are public.</p></li>    <li><h5>Protect Your Account</h5>  <p>Account security is something that you can control. Take advantage of Steam\'s security features and never let other players access your account.</p>  <p>You can find more information and resources in our dedicated <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1266-OAFV-8478">Account Security Recommendations</a> article.</p></li>    <li><h5>Engage In Responsible Steam Behavior</h5>  <p>Make sure that you are following the Steam <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810">Rules & Guidelines</a> and that you are not engaging in activities that violate the Steam subscriber agreement. Activities like this will potentially expose your account to other bad actors, making it a target of malicious activity.</p></li>    <li><h5>Unfriending and Leaving Groups</h5>  <p>Don\'t participate in groups or befriend users that are involved in harassment, scamming, or other malicious activities. Associating with players or groups that are involved in inappropriate activity will increase the likelihood that you become a target.</p></li>    <li><h5>Don’t Engage The Other Party</h5>  <p>Whether it\'s scamming, harassment, spamming or any other malicious activity, do not engage the party that is responsible. A reaction typically results in even more dedication to the activity by the other party. We recommend ignoring the behavior and utilizing the appropriate resources outlined in this FAQ.</p></li>  </ul>',

            '<p>Steam voice chat is designed to require minimal setup, provided your default Window\'s devices are already working properly. If you are experiencing a problem, try resolving it by following the troubleshooting steps outlined in this article. If you continue to experience something, or are encountering an issue that isn\'t covered here, you can always submit a detailed report to <a href="https://help.steampowered.com">Steam Support</a>.</p>  \t<p>We also encourage players to visit our official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/3/">Steam Chat Discussions</a>. There may be other users experiencing your issue who have already discovered a fix or posted a workaround. Our development team actively monitors these discussions as well.</p>  \t<li><a href="#connect">Voice chat won’t connect</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#devices">Steam doesn\'t recognize my microphone or headphones</a></li>  \t<li><a href="#sound">Voice chat sounds bad or has low quality</a></li>',
            '<div class="section" id="connect">  \t<h4>Steam voice chat won’t connect</h4></div>  \t<p>Steam voice chat connects and communicates using WebRTC standard protocols. In order to connect to a voice chat, you will need to be able to send outbound UDP traffic to remote ports 27014 through 27020 and receive responses back. If you ever see your voice status stuck at “Connecting…”, it\'s likely that this traffic is being prevented.</p>  \t<p>You can find detailed logs about your connection state and voice chat attempts by going to <i>Friends List -> Settings (Gear Icon) -> Voice -> Show Advanced Settings -> Copy Voice Logs To Clipboard</i>. If you are working with Steam Support on a voice chat issue, they may ask you to provide these logs.</p>  \t<p>You\'ll want to investigate the following configurations on your machine and make sure that your voice chat traffic is not being interfered with. Because these issues are dependent on configurations unique to your specific setup, we highly recommend that you contact a PC support specialist in your area for detailed assistance.</p>  \t  \t<ul>  \t<li><h3>Investigate router ports</h3>  \t<p>Steam voice chat uses ports 27014 through 27020 for outbound communication and will automatically select an available port to receive UDP responses.</p>  \t<p>Most routers and networks will automatically allow this traffic, but if you have changed your router configuration to be more restrictive, you will need to investigate and update that. You may consider reverting to a default configuration to further test the issue.</p></li>    \t<li><h3>Investigate firewall software</h3>  \t<p>Certain firewall configurations may prevent voice chat from working correctly. If you have a third-party firewall other than Windows Firewall on your machine, it is possible that it\'s restricting traffic.</p>  \t<p>You may consider temporarily disabling it for testing purposes. If that fixes it, you\'ll need to add rules/exceptions for Steam and steamwebhelper.exe</p></li>    \t<li><h3>Investigate anti-virus software</h3>  \t<p>Certain AV products (like versions of Kaspersky Total Security) are known to block WebRTC traffic via their AV component, even if you\'ve fully disabled the included firewall. You may need to try disabling or fully uninstalling third-party security software to check if it is interfering with Steam voice traffic. If it is, you may need to upgrade the version of your security software or contact the third-party vendor for support.</p>  \t<p>You might also try adding exceptions for Steam in your AV configuration (for example, excluding steamwebhelper.exe from live monitoring services).</p></li>  \t</ul>  \t  \t<div class="section" id="sound">  \t<h4>Voice chat sounds bad or has low quality</h4></div>  \t<p>To achieve optimum sound quality, it is important that you spend some time configuring your audio settings, both for your operating system as well as through Steam Chat.</p>  \t<p>Behavior that you may be attributing to a bug or bad performance, could simply be a setting or option that you haven\'t yet configured. You can access your chat settings via the gear icon in the upper right corner of your Steam Friends list.</p>   \t  \t<ul>  \t<li><h3>Open your settings</h3>  \t<p><b>Steam voice settings:</b> Select the gear icon in the upper right corner of your Steam Friends list, then select to the <i>voice</i> tab.</p>  \t<p><b>Windows sound settings:</b> Right-clicking on the speaker icon in your system tray and selecting either <i>Recording or Playback devices</i>. You can also access this panel from your Windows Control Panel by clicking on <i>Hardware and Sound -> Manage Audio Devices</i>.</p></li>  \t  \t<div class="section" id="devices">  \t<li><h3>Check your devices</h3>  \t<p>You\'ll first want to check that you have the correct voice Input/Output devices chosen in your Steam Chat voice settings. If set to Default, Steam chat will use the default recording and playback devices that you have set through Windows. This allows Steam to adjust automatically when Windows settings are changed.</p>  \t<p>From your Windows manage audio devices panel, you can view what devices Windows recognizes, as well as which ones are currently selected as default. The default devices should display a green checkmark and have an associated green level meter that you can use to test input/output volumes. You can also right-click any of these devices to set them as default or open properties.</p>  \t</li>  \t  \t<li><h3>Adjust input volume/gain</h3>  \t<p>Input volume/gain within Steam voice settings is the first and most important setting you should configure. You should adjust this while in a voice chat with a friend, until they can hear you at a reasonable volume and vice-versa. Increase it if you are too quiet, and decrease if you are too loud.</p>  \t<p>If you are too quiet even after raising this setting all the way, you may need to adjust your microphone\'s gain/boost setting or the Windows controlled recording level for your microphone device.</p>  \t<p>From your Windows manage audio devices panel, you can view your default devices along with their associated green level meters to test input/output. You can also right click any of the devices and select the <i>properties</i> option for more advanced volume/gain options.</p>  \t<p>Some audio hardware also has its own proprietary control panels and option menus. You would want to work with the manufacturer support team for advanced configuration help with these.</p></li>  \t  \t<li><h3>Adjust voice transmission threshold</h3>  \t<p>Once you are confident that your input volume/gain levels are set appropriately, you may want to adjust your voice transmission threshold accordingly. If the audio from your microphone is below the set threshold, Steam won’t transmit it at all.</p>   \t<p>If others are hearing white noise/typing/background sounds then you can try raising the transmission threshold to High.  If others are saying parts of your words are cut off, or that you sound choppy or cut in and out, then you may have it set it lower or even turn it off completely.</p></li>    \t<li><h3>Adjust advanced options</h3>  \t<p>Finally, there are more specific options under the Show Advanced Options section - most users will benefit from leaving all of these on. However, if friends are saying that you randomly become louder/quieter you may want to disable Automatic volume/gain control.</p>   \t<p>If nothing else in this article has helped, you may try disabling echo or noise cancellation just in case they are causing quality issues with your hardware.</p></li>  \t  \t<li><h3>Test other hardware</h3>  \t<p>Check the inputs for your microphone, headphones, speakers and other audio devices. If you are having an issue, try swapping to another available USB or audio port. If you\'re using any converters, extensions or other intermediary devices, bypass them temporarily to make sure they aren\'t contributing to the issue.</p>  \t<p>Finally, if you have extra hardware or an alternate PC, try swapping them out or testing on a different machine to eliminate the possibility that your current hardware is having an issue.</p></li>  \t</ul>',

            '<div class="section" id="trust">  <h3>What is Trusted mode?</h3>  <p>Trusted mode in CS:GO blocks third-party files from interacting with the game and is enabled by default for all CS:GO players.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="how">  <h3>How does Trusted mode help fight against cheaters? </h3>  <p>Some applications interact with CS:GO by injecting directly into the game process. This method is used by common applications as well as cheats.</p>   <p>We can vastly improve cheat prevention by restricting injections altogether — as opposed to determining whether an injection is a cheat or not. The solution is to:</p>  <ul>  <li>Provide a way to play without foreign application injections and then...</li>  <li>Update our policy to include VAC banning for any targeted process tampering.</li>  </ul>  <p>Trusted mode gives players a way to launch CS:GO and ensure that they do not accidentally run software that injects into the game. While in Trusted mode, software that normally would inject into the CS:GO process is rejected. Because CS:GO has protected itself, any injections that occur are not accidental and therefore subject to a VAC ban.</p>   </div>    <div class="section" id="prevent">  <h3>Does Trusted mode prevent cheats from working?</h3>  <p>No. Trusted mode is a minimal barrier to cheat development, however, we expect that cheats will be detected more quickly. The goal of Trusted mode is to create a barrier that can’t accidentally be crossed, and to be able to easily identify any application that does.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="banned">  <h3>Would I get banned for injecting into CS:GO if I run in normal (not Trusted) mode?</h3>  <p>No. However, over time the Trust Factor system will learn whether certain patterns of software injection are more likely to lead to cheating. So, your Trust Factor may be negatively affected by running CS:GO outside of Trusted mode.</p>  <p>We expect that some cheaters will simply run in normal mode and avoid a ban for injecting software into the game. But over time, we also expect that they will experience significantly reduced Trust because their pattern of software injection will be associated with cheating.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="whitelist">  <h3>Is there a whitelist of software that can be safely injected into CS:GO?</h3>  <p>No. Unfortunately, even benign applications are often a vector for cheats that hijack them in order to cheat in CS:GO. So in Trusted mode, all foreign software is blocked.</p>  <p>Note that in normal mode, some application injections may also be blocked. To inject into CS:GO in normal mode, the software DLLs must be signed. Injections by unsigned DLLs will result in CS:GO launching in insecure mode, which prohibits playing on VAC-secure servers.</p>  <p>If you would like to play CS:GO with software that is normally blocked you will need to <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1040-JWMT-2947">add the launch option</a> "<i>-allow_third_party_software</i>".</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="penalty">  <h3>Does normal (not Trusted) mode guarantee a penalty to the Trust score or segregation from Trust mode players?</h3>  <p>No. Playing in normal (not Trusted) mode does not guarantee a Trust score penalty and Players in both modes are not excluded from playing with each other. However, the Trust learner will eventually incorporate all of the new information in calculating Trust scores.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="perf">  <h3>Why are some players noticing performance issues in Trusted mode?</h3>  <p>CS:GO refuses injections in Trusted mode, but sometimes applications keep trying. When applications try to inject into CS:GO at very high rates (some as frequently as 1kHz), players may notice performance issues.</p>  <p>Sometimes applications attempt to inject during low level Windows mouse events, which results in noticeable performance degradation when the mouse is moved. We are internally testing a mechanism that has virtually zero overhead, even for the most zealous of injecting software. Once this new approach ships, players should no longer notice a performance impact from running in Trusted mode, even when moving the mouse. </p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="crash">  <h3>Why are some players crashing when launching CS:GO in Trusted mode?</h3>  <p>Earlier versions of CS:GO’s Trusted Mode would refuse foreign software injection in a variety of ways, but all countermeasures take place inside the CS:GO process. As a result, if those countermeasures violated expectations of the software being injected, a crash would occur inside CS:GO.</p>   <p>By capturing the vast variety of software the CS:GO community is injecting (both on purpose and by accident), we’ve identified a technique that defeats injection in a manner that is both safe and high performance. Once this solution ships, users should no longer experience crashes.</p>  </div>    <div class="section" id="loaded">  <h3>What happens if I start incompatible software after the game has launched in Trusted mode?</h3>  <p>If you start incompatible software after the game has launched in Trusted mode you may be disconnected from your match until you re-launch in Trusted mode.</p>   <p>Like other Competitive cooldowns, any cooldowns received for this reason cannot be removed from your account.</p>  </div>',

You establish these Chaperone boundaries during the setup process by designating the play area with your Controllers.  By default Chaperone displays a grid pattern when you approach the boundary.</p>  <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/steamvr/chaperone_white.png" style="width:560;height:279px;">    <h4>Does Chaperone show objects in the play area?</h4>  <p>No. Chaperone only indicates the boundaries you designate. It does not indicate physical objects in the play area, such as a table or a pet, and it does not show the floor, ceiling, or overhead obstacles.</p>  <p>You should remove all physical objects from the play area floor to avoid tripping and falling. Make note of any objects that may project into the play area (such as fans or lights) and avoid them.</p>    <h4>Will I always see the Chaperone boundaries in the play area? </h4>  <p>No. The boundaries only become visible when you approach the boundary setting—you will then see a grid pattern representing the boundary.  Also, Chaperone may not display a boundary soon enough if you are moving quickly, for example if you run or lunge suddenly. Chaperone is not a substitute for a planning a safe play area or a spotter.</p>  <p>See our <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/store/valve_index/ValveIndexSafetyAndMaintenanceInfo.pdf">Safety Guide</a> for more info.</p>    <h4>Can I change the Chaperone settings?</h4>  <p>Yes. While the default Chaperone setting provides the most visible boundaries, you can customize the Chaperone settings. When you are wearing the Headset and running VR, press the System button on your Controller to access the settings and accommodate different VR experiences. When you change VR experiences or have another player use your play area, be sure that the settings are appropriate for the use.

Refer to our <a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5523-WTGC-1875>  \t\tIndex Fit Guide</a> for instructions on setting up for the best visual experience.  \t\tIf you don\'t notice improvement after following those instructions, check all your headset connections, and restart SteamVR.  \t\tFinally, make sure you regularly clean your headset\'s lenses with the provided cleaning cloth. Avoid using liquids or cleaning products when maintaining lenses.</p>  \t<h4>No display?</h4>  \t\t<p>If you\'re not seeing anything in your headset\'s display, something isn\'t connected properly. Check the headset\'s power, USB, DisplayPort, and main cable  \t\tconnections.</p>  \t<hr class="black">  </div>    <div class="black-section">  \t<h3>SteamVR is displaying an error message</h3>  \t\t<p>Some error messages contain instructions or links to help articles. SteamVR will also recover from many temporary issues after a restart. If the error appears  \t\tagain and there are no instructions on-screen, be sure to check all of your headset\'s connections (power, USB, DisplayPort, and main cable connections). If you continue  \t\tto receive errors, please click "Contact Steam Support" below to get help.</p>  </div>    <div class="content-section">  \t<h3>Audio issues</h3>  \t\t<h4>Removing audio arms</h4>  \t\t\t<p>If you are having issues with your headset audio, you may want to try removing the speakers and ensuring the contacts are clean and free of debris.</p>  \t\t\t<p>The audio arms and off-ear speakers can be removed with a T6 Torx driver. With the weight of the headset supported, hold the audio arm in place while loosening the screw, and pull  \t\t\tstraight out. Lateral force can damage the pogo pins that carry the audio signal. To reattach the audio arm, first align the pogo pins with the gold contacts, then hold the contacting  \t\t\tsurface against the head strap while tightening the screw.</p>  \t\t<h4>No audio on off-ear speakers</h4>  \t\t\t<p>Verify that your headset is solid green in the SteamVR status window. Next, verify that Index and is the active output device in Windows while SteamVR is running (type "sound playback  \t\t\toptions" in the search bar,  \t\t\tthen check <i>Choose your output device</i>) and the default playback device in SteamVR (<i>Settings</i> > <i>Audio</i> > <i>Set Playback device to...</i>). If  \t\t\tyou\'re still having trouble, you can:  \t\t\t<ul>  \t\t\t\t<li>Unplug all other playback devices.</li>  \t\t\t\t<li>Test your system audio from the Windows Sound Panel.</li>  \t\t\t\t<li>Verify that nothing is plugged into the 3.5mm audio jack behind the face gasket.</li>  \t\t\t\t<li>Check SteamVR audio levels - with the headset on, press the System Button to bring up the VR Dashboard and check the slider in the  \t\t\t\tbottom right.</li>  \t\t\t</ul>  \t\t<h4>Low audio volume</h4>  \t\t\t<p>Be sure the off-ear speakers are positioned correctly. You can check <a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5523-WTGC-1875>our  \t\t\tIndex Fit Guide</a> for more information. If your issue continues, play test sounds from the Windows Sound Panel to verify that your system audio is working  \t\t\tcorrectly, then try to retest the issue with another game or application. Finally, check all your headset connections, exit Steam VR, and restart Windows.  \t\t\tIf you continue to experience low audio, please click "Contact Steam Support" below to get help.</p>    \t<hr class="black">    \t<h3>Microphone issues</h3>  \t\t<h4>No microphone</h4>  \t\t\t<p>Verify that the headset is solid green in the SteamVR status window. Then confirm that the Index microphone is the default recording device for Windows (type "sound" in the search  \t\t\tbar, then check the recording tab).</p>  \t\t\t<p>If another device is selected, switch to this one instead, then re-launch your game or restart SteamVR. If Windows continues to default to another recording device,  \t\t\tcheck to make sure that SteamVR is defaulting to the correct device (<i>Settings</i> > <i>Audio</i> > <i>Set Record device to...</i>). Finally, you can try using a  \t\t\tdifferent USB port for your headset connection if you continue to experience issues.</p>  \t\t<h4>Microphone distortion</h4>  \t\t\t<p>If you\'re experiencing distortion or disrupted mic audio, try lowering the microphone levels. Type "sound" in the search bar, then select <i>Recording</i>, right-  \t\t\tclick the <i>Digital Audio Interface</i> and select <i>Properties</i>, and lower the slider under the <i>Levels</i> tab.</p>  \t\t\t<p>You can also try adjusting the gain inside of the application you\'re having trouble with. Finally, you can try using a different USB port for your headset connection  \t\t\tif you continue to experience issues.</p>    </div>    <div class="black-section">  \t<h3>Caring for your headset</h3>  \t\t<h4>Avoiding sunlight</h4>  \t\t\t<p>Even while indoors, exposure to sunlight can cause permenent damage to the display panels in your headset. An uninterrupted lens exposure of less than 10 seconds can begin to cause  \t\t\t\tnoticeable damage under the right circumstances. To protect your headset, observe the following:  \t\t\t\t<ul>  \t\t\t\t\t<li>Take care not to expose the headset\'s lenses to sunlight during use.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t<li>Don\'t leave your headset unattended in a place where it may be exposed to sunlight.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t<li>Transport your headset in a manner that protects it from exposure.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t<li>Be sure to store your headset away from any possible exposure while not in use.</li>  \t\t\t\t</ul>  \t\t<h4>Cleaning</h4>  \t\t\t<p><font color="#DA70D6";>To clean the headset\'s exterior surfaces</font>, use a dry, clean cloth to wipe down as necessary. Isopropyl alcohol may also be used if a dry cloth is insufficient, but  \t\t\t\ttake care to apply it only to the cloth, using small quantities and avoiding all non-exterior surfaces.</p>  \t\t\t<p><font color="#DA70D6";>To clean the headstrap and face gasket padding</font>, use a damp cloth to scrub the padding. The padding material is antimicrobial and won\'t normally require  \t\t\t\tantibacterial or other chemical cleaners, but isopropyl alcohol can be applied to the cloth in small quanitities if necessary.</p>  \t\t\t<p><font color="#DA70D6";>To clean the lenses</font>, use the microfiber cloth that was included with your headset. Gently wipe in a circular motion, starting at the lens center and moving outward.  \t\t\t\tDo not use cleaning agents on lenses.</p>  </div>    <div class="content-section">    \t<div align="center">    \t\t<h2><b><font color="#DA70D6";>Support Resources</font></b></h2>  \t\t<div class="row">    \t\t\t<div class="column">  \t\t\t  \t<a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=115>  \t\t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_faq.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">  \t\t\t    <p><font color="white";>View other FAQs</font></p>  \t\t\t  \t</a>  \t\t\t </div>    \t\t <div class="column">  \t\t  \t<a href=https://steamcommunity.com/app/250820/discussions/>  \t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_developer.png" style="width:70px; height:70px;">  \t\t    <p><font color="white";>Visit the community Forums</font></p>  \t\t\t</a>  \t\t </div>    \t\t  <div class="column">  \t\t\t<a href=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithValveIndex>  \t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_steam.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">  \t\t    <p><font color="white";>Contact Steam Support</font></p>  \t\t\t</a>  \t\t  </div>  \t</div>  </div>    </body>    <style class="Index-packaging-css" type="text/css">      \t.right_col {  \t\tdisplay: none;  \t}    \t.left_col {  \t\twidth: 100%;  \t}    \t#content {  \t\tfont-family: "Motiva Sans Light", "Motiva Sans", Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;  \t\t-moz-box-sizing: border-box;  \t\tbox-sizing: border-box;  \t}    \t#content .pagetext {  \t\tpadding: 13px 13px 0;  \t\tbackground: none;  \t}    \t#content #question .content-section {  \t\tbackground: #181818;    \t}    \t#content #question .black-section {  \t\tbackground: #000000;  \t\tpadding: 13px 13px 0;  \t}    \t#question {  \t\tborder-top: none;  \t\tmargin-bottom: 0px;  \t\tnone repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  \t}    \t#question > h1:first-child {  \t\tdisplay: none;  \t}    \t#wrapper {  \t\tbackground: #101010;  \t}    \t.content-section {          position: relative;  \t\tpadding: 13px;  \t\tbackground: none repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  \t\tmargin-bottom: 0px;  \t\tz-index: 999;  \t}    \t.black-section {  \t\tposition: relative;  \t\tpadding: 13px;  \t\tbackground: none repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  \t\tmargin-bottom: 0px;  \t\tz-index: 999;  \t}    \t.content-section img {  \t\tdisplay: block;  \t\tmargin: 20px auto 0;  \t}    \th1 {  \t\tfont-size: 2.5em;  \t}    \th3 {  \t\tfont-size: 2em;  \t}    \th4 {  \t\tColor: #DA70D6;  \t}    \th5 {  \t\tColor: #94ffff;  \t}      \t.button {  \t  background-color: #DA70D6;  \t  border: none;  \t  color: white;  \t  padding:30px 35px;  \t  text-align: center;  \t  text-decoration: none;  \t  display: inline-block;  \t  font-size: 16px;  \t  margin: 4px 2px;  \t  -webkit-transition-duration: 0.4s; /* Safari */  \t  transition-duration: 0.4s;  \t  cursor: pointer;  \t}    \t.button1 {  \t  background-color: #000000;  \t  color: black;  \t  border: 2px solid #000000;  \t}    \t.button1:hover {  \t  background-color: #DA70D6;  \t  color: white;  \t}    \thr {  \t\tdisplay: block;  \t\tmargin-top: 15px;  \t\tmargin-bottom: 15px;  \t\tmargin-left: 250px;  \t\tmargin-right: 250px;  \t\tborder-width: 1px;  \t}    \thr.black {   \t\tborder: 1px solid black;  \t}    \thr.grey {    \t\tborder: 1px solid #181818;  \t}    \t.topic-description-container {  \t\tfont-size: 16px;  \t}    \t.topic-header-text {  \t\tmargin-bottom: 10px;  \t}    \t.nav-container-float{  \t\twidth: 50%;  \t\tfloat: left;  \t\tcolor: #67c1f5;  \t\tfont-weight: bold;  \t}    \t.clear-float {  \t\tclear: both;  \t\theight: 0;  \t\tcontent: hidden;  \t}    \thtml {  \t\tmin-height: 100%;  \t    margin: 0;  \t}    \tbody {  \t\tmin-height: 100%;  \t    margin: 0;  \t\tbackground-color: black;  \t}    \t.horiz-rule {  \t\theight: 1px;  \t\twidth: 100%;  \t\tborder-top: 1px solid #fff;  \t\tmargin: 25px 0;  \t}    \t.column {  \t    float: left;  \t\twidth: 33.33%;  \t    padding: 10px;  \t}    \t.left {  \t  width: 20%;  \t  margin: 0 auto;  \t  padding: 30px  \t}    \t.right {  \t  width: 80%;  \t}    \t.half {  \t  width: 40%;  \t}    \t.row:after {  \t  content: "";  \t  display: table;  \t  clear: both;  \t}    \t.container {  \t\tposition: relative;  \t\tcolor: white;  \t}    \t.bottom-left {  \t  position: absolute;  \t  bottom: 8px;  \t  left: 16px;  \t}    \t.bottom-right {  \t  position: absolute;  \t  bottom: 8px;  \t  right: 16px;  \t  z-index: 999;  \t}    </style>  </html>',

To minimize potential tracking issues in your environment, start with these steps:</p>  \t<h4>Remove Film Sticker</h4>   \t\t<p>Base Stations are packaged with a protective sticker on the front-facing surface. The sticker can interfere with tracking if it is not removed before use.</p>      <h4>Check Base Station positioning</h4>   \t\t<p>Base Stations should be aimed and angled toward the center of the play area. In the ideal setup, Base Stations should be\tabove head height (at least 6.5 feet / 2 meters), angled down by 30-45 degrees, positioned no more than 16 feet / 5 meters apart, and place opposite one another in separate corners of the play area. Make sure your Base Stations are mounted or set on a solid surface that isn\'t prone to vibration or movements - bumps and vibrations can cause tracking problems.</p>  \t\t<p>Many other setups are also perfectly functional. Remember that if you are placing a Base Station at head height or lower, you should take height into account when angling deciding how to angle it. A base station on a coffee table should be pointed slightly upward, while one between waist and should height won\'t need to be angled at all.</p>      <h4>Remove or cover reflective surfaces in your play area</h4>   \t\t<p>Objects such as windows, mirrors, televisions, and monitor screens can interfere with tracking. If you are losing tracking or motion controllers occasionally float away in VR, try covering or removing reflective surfaces in your play area.</p>  \t<h4>Rerun Room Setup</h4>   \t\t<p>Performing a fresh room setup can help clear up any issues caused by changes to the environment or Base Station positioning.</p>  \t<h4>Performance issues can mimic tracking issues</h4>   \t\t<p>Spikes in performance quality and "lagging" behavior are usually caused by computer configurations that don\'t meet our recommended requirements or aren\'t functioning optimally. Local issues like these are tough to troubleshoot, so we recommend checking with a local computer specialist to find out how to best improve your computer\'s performance.</p>  \t\t<p>To check for spikes in performance, run SteamVR and navigate to <i>Settings</i> > <i>Video</i> > <i>Advanced Frame Timing</i>. For detailed information on how to use this feature, <a href=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamVR/Frame_Timing>check out this developer article</a>.</p>  <hr class="grey">\t  <br>  </div>    <div class="content-section">  \t<h3 id="basenotgreen">Base Station is not solid green in SteamVR status window</h3>  \t\t<p>Check the LED in the top center of the Base Station\'s front (convex) surface:</p>  \t<h4>LED is flashing blue</h4>  \t\t<p>This indicates that the Base Station is not stable or is encountering vibrations. This will prevent the laser from functioning. Make sure your Base Station is in a stable location and is not being subject to vibration or shaking. If the problem continues, consider moving the location of your Base Stations.</p>  \t<h4>LED is flashing red</h4>  \t\t<p>The Base Station has encountered an error. Please click "Contact Steam Support" below to get help.</p>  \t<h4>No LED</h4>  \t\t<p>The Base Station is not receiving power. Try swapping your other Base Station to the same power outlet to test whether the device or the outlet is at fault. If a Base Station will not power on and the outlet is not causing the problem, please click "Contact Steam Support" below to get help.</p>  <hr class="black">\t  </div>    <div class="black-section">  \t<h3>Channel conflicts</h3>  \t\t<p>SteamVR will notify you if it detects a channel conflict in your Base Stations. Although Base Stations should arrive correctly configured, you can change their   \t\tchannel settings from the SteamVR status window if the <i>Base Station Setup Error</i> message appears. To do this:  \t<ul>  \t\t<li>Navigate to the SteamVR status window.</li>  \t\t<li>Select <i>Settings</i> > <i>Base Station</i> > <i>Configure Base Station Channels</i></li>   \t\t<li>Wait for SteamVR to identify nearby base stations, then either select <i>Automatic Configuration</i> or manually change each channel by clicking on it.</li>  \t</ul>  \t\t<p>Base Stations packaged with VR Kits are configured to channels 1 and 2. Individually purchased Base Stations have their channels set between channels 3 and 16.   \t\tIf you\'re using a fourth Base Station or using VR in a place with more than one play area set up, you may need to update channel settings to avoid conflicts.</p>    <hr class="grey">\t    \t<h3>Power Management issues</h3>  \t\t<p>SteamVR\'s Base Station Power Management  feature is turned OFF by default. Turning this feature ON ensures that your Base Stations power off when not in use to reduce power usage and extend their lifespan.</p>  \t\t<p>Valve recommends turning this feature ON if you are not in a shared tracking space.</p>  \t\t<p>You can turn this feature on/off at any time by navigating to SteamVR->Settings->Base Station->Power Management.</p>  \t\t<ul>  \t\t\t<li>When this feature is OFF, your Base Stations will remain powered and emitting whenever they are plugged in.</li>  \t\t\t<li>When this feature is ON, your Base Stations will go into standby when SteamVR is not in use and wake up when SteamVR starts.</li>  \t\t</ul>  \t\t<p>If you\'re having problems with your Power Management settings, please click <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithValveIndex">Contact Steam Support</a> to get help.</p>  \t\t<p>If you are using VR in a shared tracking space with multiple instances of SteamVR running, turn off Base Station Power Management to avoid power state conflicts.</p>    <hr class="grey">\t    \t<h3>Other questions</h3>  \t\t<h4>Base Station compatibility?</h4>  \t\t<ul>  \t\t\t<li>1.0 (HTC-branded) and 2.0 (Valve-branded) Base Stations will not work with each other in the same VR setup.</li>  \t\t\t<li>Index will work with both 1.0 and 2.0 Base Stations.</li>  \t\t\t<li>2.0 Base Stations will not work with the original Vive headset or Wand controllers, but will work with the Vive Pro product family.</li>  \t\t</ul>  \t\t  \t\t<h4>How many Base Stations do I need?</h4>  \t\t<p>We recommend two Base Stations for most room-scale play areas. If you\'re covering an area larger than 5 x 5 meters (~16 x 16 feet), you can add additional Base Stations for additional tracking and increased accuracy.</p>  \t\t<p>For seated or standing-only play areas, one Base Station can be sufficient, but two are still recommended to ensure your Base Stations don\'t lose sight of your devices.</p>  </div>      <div class="content-section">    \t<div align="center">    \t\t<h2><b><font color="#DA70D6";>Support Resources</font></b></h2>  \t\t<div class="row">  \t\t    \t\t\t<div class="column">  \t\t\t  \t<a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=115>  \t\t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_faq.png?12716" style="width:70px;

If safe mode resolves your issue, it is likely that you have installed something that is interfering with SteamVR. For example, some VR "utility" applications such as Natural Locomotion and LIV are known to conflict with SteamVR in some cases.</p>\t\t\t  \t\t  </div>      <div class="content-section">  \t<div align="center">    \t\t<h2><b><font color="#DA70D6";>Support Resources</font></b></h2>  \t\t<div class="row">  \t\t    \t\t\t<div class="column">  \t\t\t  \t<a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=115>  \t\t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_faq.png?12716" style="width:70px;

Your friends will see when you are online and playing a game will show you as in-game.</li>  \t<li><b>Away</b> - manually let your friends know that you are not available. Your online status will automatically switch to snooze once you have been inactive for a long period of time.</li>  \t<li><b>Invisible</b> - This status will show you as offline to other players. You’ll still be able to view your friends list, send and receive messages and otherwise participate in the community. However, other players won\'t see you as online.</li>  \t<li><b>Offline</b> - This status will actually sign you out of the Steam community. In addition to the affects of invisible status, you wont be able to communicate with friends and Steam features that depend on being online will not work.</li>  \t<li><b>Do Not Disturb</b> - This setting simply controls whether or not you will receive notifications from chat, invites and other requests.</li>  </ul>    <div class="section" id="settings">  <h4>Settings & Notifications</h4></div>  <p>The gear next to your profile name will take you to your Friends & Chat settings.

But we know that watching someone play a game in VR is an entertaining experience on its own, and many of you will want to share the game with others &mdash; whether in the same room or over a livestream. Half-Life: Alyx has a number of settings dedicated to improving the experience of watching the game being played on a TV or monitor. They can be found in the game\'s menu under <font color="#fb7e14";>Options > Spectator.</font></p>  <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/spectator.png">  <ul>  <li><h4>Spectator HUD: Off, Small, Medium, Large</h4></li>  <p>Choose whether to enable the spectator-specific HUD, and its relative size. Half-Life: Alyx comes with a HUD just for the people watching on the secondary monitor. It shows the player\'s health, ammo, resin count, and what items they\'re carrying. We\'ve found this makes watching someone play Half-Life: Alyx more comprehensible and fun, because it ensures spectators have full view of information about the player\'s state, which in some circumstances may otherwise only be visible to the player. For example, players often check their health by raising their hand a little bit and looking down with their eyes instead of raising their hand up to their face or looking directly down at it. If you\'re watching on a monitor you wouldn\'t see that health check because it\'s so far out of view.</p>  <li><h4>Spectator Camera Smoothing: Off, Low, Medium, High</h4></li>  <p>Choose how much you\'d like to smooth out or remove the rotational jitter that come from playing a game in VR. Enabling smoothing makes the experience of spectating the game far cleaner. It is a realtime effect that is only applied to the spectator view (not inside the headset) and has minimal to no impact on graphical performance. We recommend setting it to low or medium, but if you find you prefer how the spectator view looks with no camera roll at all, you can set it to high. Try the different settings and see what you prefer.</p>  <li><h4>Spectator Eye: Left, Right</h4></li>  <p>Choose whether the spectator view displays the output from your left or right eye. We recommend setting it to whichever eye you usually aim down, so people watching you play will be able to look down weapon sights with you.</p>  </ul>  </div>    <div class="content-section">  <h1>Spectator Subtitles</h1>  <p>As an alternative to the in-game subtitles designed for VR players, you may find it useful to enable subtitles in the Spectator Window only. In this case, the subtitles will be displayed only in the Spectator Window and not in the VR view.  The toggle for this setting can be found in the game\'s menu under <font color="#fb7e14";>Options > Subtitles.</font></p>  <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/spectatorsubtitle.png">  </div>    <div class="black-section">  <h1>Advanced Settings</h1>  <p>There are some advanced tools available for more specialized purposes. You might find these useful if you want to capture a series of short and specific shots for a video, or if you want to fine-tune the way the HUD appears in a stream. Accessing these settings requires enabling the development console (go to Half-Life: Alyx\'s game properties in Steam, and add <font color="#fb7e14";>-console -vconsole</font> to the Launch Options). For a typical playthrough, you won\'t need to adjust these settings at all.</p>  <ul>  <li><h4>Full In-Camera Smoothing</h4></li>  <p>Full in-camera smoothing is a combination of effects applied to all three axes of camera rotation, to create a very cinematic look for your VR camera. This tool is perfect for capturing small moments that you want to look just right &mdash; but because it lags the game camera inside your headset, it can be disorienting and is not meant to be used while playing normally. This is the tool we used to capture most of the Half-Life: Alyx gameplay videos we released. While it is uncomfortable to play the game in this mode, it is great for capturing footage that <i>feels</i> like it does when you\'re playing normally. (Note that this tool is different to Spectator Camera Smoothing, which filters out roll rotation only as a post-processing effect, and has no impact on what you see in the headset.)</p>  <p>To enable full in-camera smoothing, press the tilde key <font color="#fb7e14";>(~)</font> to open the developer console, and type <b><font color="#fb7e14";>vr_camera_decay_roll_halflife 0.5</font></b>, then <b><font color="#fb7e14";>vr_camera_decay_yaw_pitch_halflife 0.09</font></b>. Those are the values we used for our gameplay videos, but you are free to tune them however you\'d like. Using these values, for example, your camera roll will take 0.5 seconds to get halfway between the currently-displayed amount of camera roll and your actual head position, and the yaw and pitch will take 0.09 seconds to do the same. The higher the values, the more fine rotation you will filter out, and the laggier your vision will become in the headset.</p>  <p>To disable in-camera smoothing, set both <b><font color="#fb7e14";>vr_camera_decay_roll_halflife 0</font></b> and <b><font color="#fb7e14";>vr_camera_decay_yaw_pitch_halflife 0</font></b>.</p>  <li><h4>Fine Tune Spectator HUD Size</h4></li>  <p>If you would prefer a different spectator HUD size than the default options, you can fine-tune the size in the developer console. Press the tilde key <font color="#fb7e14";>(~)</font> to open the console and type <b><font color="#fb7e14";>hlvr_spectator_hud_size 100</font></b> to set the HUD to its default size of Medium. Instead of 100, you can use any value between 50 and 150. Use a value of 0 to hide the spectator HUD entirely.</p>  </ul>    <p>If you are having issues with tracking stability or other VR issues, check out the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7897-DHKB-9990">SteamVR base station and tracking articles.</a></p>  </div>    <hr class="grey">    <div class="black-section">    <div align="center">    <h2><b><font color="#fb7e14";>Support Resources</font></b></h2>  <div class="row">    <div class="column">  <a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=117>  <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_faq.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">  <p><font color="white";>View other FAQs</font></p>  </a>  </div>    <div class="column">  <a href=https://www.half-life.com/en/alyx/>  <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_developer.png" style="width:70px; height:70px;">  <p><font color="white";>See more about Alyx</font></p>  </a>  </div>    <div class="column">  <a href=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithValveIndex>  <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_steam.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">  <p><font color="white";>Contact Steam Support</font></p>  </a>  </div>  </div>  </div>      </body>    <style class="Alyx-streaming-spectating-css" type="text/css">    .right_col {  display: none;  }    .left_col {  width: 100%;  }    #content {  font-family: "Motiva Sans Light", "Motiva Sans", Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;  box-sizing: border-box;  }    #content .pagetext {  padding: 13px 13px 0;  background: none;  }    #content #answer .content-section {  background: #292929;  }    #content #answer .black-section {  background: #000000;  padding: 13px 13px 0;  }    #question {  border-top: none;  margin-bottom: 0px;  none repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  }    #question > h1:first-child {  display: none;  }    #wrapper {  background: black;  }    .black-section {  position: relative;  padding: 13px;  background: none repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  margin-bottom: 0px;  z-index: 999;  }    .content-section {  position: relative;  padding: 13px;  background: none repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  margin-bottom: 0px;  z-index: 999;  }    .content-section img {  display: block;  margin: 20px auto 0;  }    h1 {  font-size: 2.5em;  }    h4 {  Color: #fb7e14;  }    sup {  vertical-align: top;  font-size: smaller;  }    .topic-description-container {  font-size: 16px;  }    .topic-header-text {  margin-bottom: 10px;  }    .nav-container-float{  width: 50%;  float: left;  color: #67c1f5;  font-weight: bold;  }    .clear-float {  clear: both;  height: 0;  content: hidden;  }    html {  min-height: 100%;  margin: 0;  }    body {  min-height: 100%;  margin: 0;  background-color: black;  }    .horiz-rule {  height: 1px;  width: 100%;  border-top: 1px solid #fff;  margin: 25px 0;  }    .column {  float: left;  width: 33.33%;  padding: 10px;  }    .left {  width: 20%;  margin: 0 auto;  padding: 30px  }    .right {  width: 80%;  }    .half {  width: 40%;  }    .row:after {  content: "";  display: table;  clear: both;  }    .container {  position: relative;  color: white;  }    .bottom-left {  position: absolute;  bottom: 8px;  left: 16px;  vertical-align: top;  }    .bottom-right {  position: absolute;  bottom: 8px;  right: 16px;  z-index: 999;  }    </style>    </html>',

The first time you launch Half-Life: Alyx (or when your hardware changes), the game will automatically benchmark your CPU and GPU, look at the available system memory, and try to pick the most appropriate graphics settings. That said, there\'s always room to fine-tune and push the envelope further. Half-Life: Alyx can keep an 8-core CPU with a 12GB GPU completely busy running complex VR gameplay at up to 144Hz&mdash;but even if your PC doesn\'t look anything like that, we encourage looking through the game\'s advanced performance options and seeing how high your system can go. From the main menu, navigate to (visit <font color="#fb7e14";>Settings > Performance</font> and click the gear icon in the bottom left corner).</p>  \t\t<p>Since every PC is different, there are always ways to further fine tune the experience to get the most out of your setup. If you are having technical issues or think you could be getting better performance out of your system when playing Half-Life: Alyx, here are some performance and troubleshooting tips.</p>  \t<h4>Troubleshooting Checklist</h4>  \t\t<p>If Half-Life: Alyx isn\'t running as well as you think it should on your PC, we recommend running through this checklist first. These may sound obvious, but more issues than you\'d expect are fixed just by investigating the basics.</p>  \t\t<ul>  \t\t\t<li>Make sure you have the latest <a href="https://www.geforce.com/drivers">NVIDIA</a> or <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support">AMD</a> driver. Both have released game-optimized drivers for Half-Life: Alyx that we recommend using.</li>  \t\t\t<li>Make sure your primary hard drive has plenty of free space.</li>  \t\t\t<li>Try closing other software you have running in the background - even web browsers can sometimes use a surprising amount of system resources. In particular, check if you have other applications open using dedicated GPU memory. (You can check this by pressing ctrl-shift-esc to open the Windows Task Manager, browse to the Details tab, right-click the header, choose "Select Columns" and then check "Dedicated GPU memory.")</li>  \t\t\t<li>Check the robustness of your VR setup, as bad tracking can sometimes feel similar to low framerate. Consult the documentation of your VR system. For SteamVR tracking guidance when using Valve Index or HTC Vive, visit <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7897-DHKB-9990">this page.</a></li>  \t\t</ul>  \t<h4>Tuning in SteamVR</h4>  \t\t<p>There are further performance tuning tools available within the SteamVR settings menu. These settings are worth double checking especially if you think you might have changed them for other games.</p>  \t\t<ul>  \t\t\t<li>Check your SteamVR render resolution by going to the SteamVR menu and navigating to <font color="#fb7e14";>Settings > Video > Render Resolution</font>. Try setting the render resolution to "Auto" if it\'s not already. If that noticeably helps improve your performance, you can try reducing it further.</li>  \t\t\t<li>If you have a Valve Index headset, Half-Life: Alyx can run at ultra-high framerates up to 144hz. You can adjust the refresh rate by going to the SteamVR menu and navigating to <font color="#fb7e14";>Settings > General > Refresh Rate</font>. Reducing the refresh rate can reduce the load placed on your GPU. If you think you are experiencing frame rate lag caused by an overtaxed GPU, try lowering your refresh rate to 90hz.</li>\t\t  \t\t</ul>  \t<h4>In-game Performance Settings</h4>  \t\t<p>Half-Life: Alyx\'s advanced performance settings are available by browsing to <font color="#fb7e14";>Settings > Performance</font>, and clicking the gear icon in the bottom left corner. If the game is already running great, and you know your PC well enough to think you can push it further, this is the place to look for more knobs to crank up.</p>  \t\t<p>If game performance is worse than you think it should be and none of the above helps, try running the game on "Low" fidelity settings, by opening the game menu and browsing to <font color="#fb7e14";>Settings > Performance > Low Fidelity</font>. If that helps your performance significantly, try turning it back up to a point your computer is comfortable with.</p>  \t\t<ul>  \t\t\t<li><font color="#fb7e14";>Note that Texture Quality is independent of overall fidelity</font>, so you can try the same process but with texture quality. Try setting them to "Low" and then working your way back up. The Texture Quality setting can be adjusted in Advanced Performance Settings, by selecting the gear icon in the lower left corner of the Performance settings page.</li>  \t\t\t<li>The best place to test performance is inside the game itself, instead of the main menu. All performance settings can be adjusted while you are in game, so if you are seeing performance improvements from adjusting the overall Performance quality toggle, you can go into Advanced Settings and tune from there.</li>\t\t  \t\t</ul>    </div>      <hr class="grey">    <div class="black-section">    \t<div align="center">    \t\t<h2><b><font color="#fb7e14";>Support Resources</font></b></h2>  \t\t<div class="row">    \t\t\t<div class="column">  \t\t\t  \t<a href=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=117>  \t\t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_faq.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">  \t\t\t    <p><font color="white";>View other FAQs</font></p>  \t\t\t  \t</a>  \t\t\t </div>    \t\t <div class="column">  \t\t  \t<a href=https://www.half-life.com/en/alyx/>  \t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_developer.png" style="width:70px; height:70px;">  \t\t    <p><font color="white";>See more about Alyx</font></p>  \t\t\t</a>  \t\t </div>    \t\t  <div class="column">  \t\t\t<a href=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithValveIndex>  \t\t    <img src="https://support.steampowered.com/images/faq/steam_vr/vive_install/SteamVR_Support_icon_steam.png?12716" style="width:70px; height:70px;">  \t\t    <p><font color="white";>Contact Steam Support</font></p>  \t\t\t</a>  \t\t  </div>  \t</div>  </div>      </body>    <style class="Alyx-faq-css" type="text/css">    \t.right_col {  \t\tdisplay: none;  \t}    \t.left_col {  \t\twidth: 100%;  \t}    \t#content {  \t\tfont-family: "Motiva Sans Light", "Motiva Sans", Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;  \t\t-moz-box-sizing: border-box;  \t\tbox-sizing: border-box;  \t}    \t#content .pagetext {  \t\tpadding: 13px 13px 0;  \t\tbackground: none;  \t}    \t#content #question .content-section {  \t\tbackground: #292929;  \t}    \t#content #question .black-section {  \t\tbackground: #000000;  \t\tpadding: 13px 13px 0;  \t}    \t#question {  \t\tborder-top: none;  \t\tmargin-bottom: 0px;  \t\tnone repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  \t}    \t#question > h1:first-child {  \t\tdisplay: none;  \t}    \t#wrapper {  \t\t  background: black;  \t}    \t.black-section {          position: relative;  \t\tpadding: 13px;  \t\tbackground: none repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  \t\tmargin-bottom: 0px;  \t\tz-index: 999;  \t}    \t.content-section {          position: relative;  \t\tpadding: 13px;  \t\tbackground: none repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);  \t\tmargin-bottom: 0px;  \t\tz-index: 999;  \t}    \t.content-section img {  \t\tdisplay: block;  \t\tmargin: 20px auto 0;  \t}    \th1 {  \t\tfont-size: 2.5em;  \t}    \th4 {  \t\tColor: #fb7e14;  \t}    \tsup {  \t    vertical-align: top;  \t    font-size: smaller;  \t}    \t.topic-description-container {  \t\tfont-size: 16px;  \t}    \t.topic-header-text {  \t\tmargin-bottom: 10px;  \t}    \t.nav-container-float{  \t\twidth: 50%;  \t\tfloat: left;  \t\tcolor: #67c1f5;  \t\tfont-weight: bold;  \t}    \t.clear-float {  \t\tclear: both;  \t\theight: 0;  \t\tcontent: hidden;  \t}    \thtml {  \t\tmin-height: 100%;  \t    margin: 0;  \t}    \tbody {  \t\tmin-height: 100%;  \t    margin: 0;  \t\tbackground-color: black;  \t}    \t.horiz-rule {  \t\theight: 1px;  \t\twidth: 100%;  \t\tborder-top: 1px solid #fff;  \t\tmargin: 25px 0;  \t}    \t.column {  \t    float: left;  \t\twidth: 33.33%;  \t    padding: 10px;  \t}    \t.left {  \t  width: 20%;  \t  margin: 0 auto;  \t  padding: 30px  \t}    \t.right {  \t  width: 80%;  \t}    \t.half {  \t  width: 40%;  \t}    \t.row:after {  \t  content: "";  \t  display: table;  \t  clear: both;  \t}    \t.container {  \t\tposition: relative;  \t\tcolor: white;  \t}    \t.bottom-left {  \t  position: absolute;  \t  bottom: 8px;  \t  left: 16px;  \t  vertical-align: top;  \t}    \t.bottom-right {  \t  position: absolute;  \t  bottom: 8px;  \t  right: 16px;  \t  z-index: 999;  \t}    </style>    </html>',

            "When is my IP Address shared with other players?  What are the downsides?  How can I control when this happens?",
            "<div class=\"section\" id=\"intro\"></div>  <h4>What is Peer-to-Peer Networking?</h4>  <p>Peer-to-peer networking is when messages are sent directly from one player to another.  Contrast this with dedicated server networking, where players do not talk to each other directly, but instead all players talk to a game server.</p>  <h4>Peer-to-Peer Connections Using Your Public IP Address</h4>  <p>Most games that use peer-to-peer networking attempt to establish a direct connection between the players, meaning the players share their public IP addresses with each other, and communicate directly using those IP addresses.  Most players' computers connect to the Internet through a router, and the public IP address is the address of the router.  The router serves as a firewall, only allowing certain traffic from the outside world in to your computer.  In order for peer-to-peer networking to connect players using their public IP addresses, a process called NAT traversal is used to negotiate firewalls and obtain the IP addresses.</p>  <h4>What's the Risk of Sharing My Public IP Address?</h4>  <p>If another player has your public IP address, they can send packets directly to you.  If they are friendly, this is great, because this is often the fastest path of communication.  But if a malicious user obtains your public IP address, they can flood your Internet connection with packets.  This is often called a DoS (denial of service) attack.  Many consumer Internet connections can be easily overwhelmed by a relatively low volume DoS attack.</p>  <h4>Peer-to-Peer Connections Using Relays</h4>  <p>NAT traversal does not always succeed in establishing a direct connection, depending on the firewall configuration.  When this happens, the players require the assistance of a relay to talk to each other.  Each player's firewall will accept packets from the relay.  (<a href=\"https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/\">Here</a> is a good article that describes the process in detail.)  A benefit with using relays is it's not necessary to share you IP address with the other player.  Often, relays are used as a last resort, only if a direct connection cannot be made, since relaying packets is relatively costly service.  In this case, IP addresses have already been exchanged and a DoS attack is still possible, even though a direct connection was not possible.  If one or both peers chooses not to share their IP address, then a direct connection is not possible and NAT traversal will require the use of the relay.  In order for a direct connection to be made, both peers must share their IP address.  </p>  <h4>How can I Prevent Games From Sharing My IP Address?</h4>  <p>The only reliable way to prevent any game from sharing your IP address is to use a VPN.  In this situation, your public IP will be the address of the VPN provider's computer, and your IP will stay private.</p>  <h4>Does Steam Ever Share My IP Address?</h4>  <p>Steam doesn't share your IP address with other players.  Whenever peer-to-peer networking is needed, for example in a voice chat, that communication is always relayed.  However, we don't control what games using peer-to-peer connectivity do.  </p>  <h4>What about games that use Steam Networking APIs?</h4>  <p>If a game uses our newest networking APIs (ISteamNetworkingSockets and ISteamNetworkingMessages), the traffic can be relayed using Steam Datagram Relay (SDR), Valve's worldwide backbone and network of relays, and you can decide when to allow an app to share your IP address.  Under Steam / Settings / In-Game / Steam Networking, there is an option that controls when your IP address is revealed:</p>  <ul>  <li><b>Never</b>.  Never share your IP with any player.  Always relay peer-to-peer traffic.  </li>  <li><b>Always</b>.  Always allow the app to share your IP with any player.  If the other player also shares their IP address, a direct connection may be established.  If not, it will be relayed.  </li>  <li><b>Default</b>.  This will not share your IP address, unless it appears necessary to avoid excessive ping times.  </li>  </ul>    <p>We recommend that most players leave the setting on default.  If you experience high ping times and would prefer to risk sharing your IP address to attempt to get a faster connection, you might try changing the value to \"Always\".  Remember that just because you share your IP address does not mean a direct connection will be made.  The other player must share their IP address, and NAT traversal must succeed in negotiating the firewalls.</p>  <p>  Please note that the game may choose to force the use of a relay for certain connections, such as in a high-stakes competitive mode where DoS attacks are more likely.  </p>  <h4>Steam's Peer-to-Peer Networking Goals</h4>  <p>  Steam is working towards a world where no one needs to share their IP address to have a good connection.  Unfortunately, we're not there yet.  Until then, we will try to hide IP addresses for as many players as possible while still delivering a good networking experience and giving players who care about their privacy a way to protect it.  </p>",

            '<a name="what"></a>  <h4>蒸汽平台令牌是什么，有什么用？</h4>  <p>蒸汽平台令牌可以应用至您的蒸汽平台帐户，提供额外一级的安全防护。蒸汽平台帐户的第一级安全防护就是您的登录凭据：您的蒸汽平台帐户名与密码。通过蒸汽平台令牌，就能对您的帐户应用第二级安全防护，使不法之徒更难盗用您的蒸汽平台帐户。</p>  <p>一旦您的帐户启用了蒸汽平台令牌，当您从一台无法识别的设备登录您的蒸汽平台帐户时，您需要提供特殊验证码，以验证这是您的帐户。您会收到含有特殊验证码的电子邮件。</p>  <p><a name="enableemail"></a></p>  <h4>如何通过电子邮件来启用蒸汽平台令牌？</h4>  <p>如果您的电子邮件已经过验证，且验证之后您已重启蒸汽平台两次，那么您蒸汽平台帐户的蒸汽平台令牌已默认启用。如果您在禁用蒸汽平台令牌之后希望重新激活，请按以下步骤操作：</p>  <ol>  <li><span class="bold">确定您的电子邮件联系地址已通过蒸汽平台验证。</span><br />  您必须在蒸汽平台上验证您的电子邮件联系地址。您可以打开蒸汽平台帐户设置，查看您的电子邮件地址是否已经过验证。已验证的邮箱会被标记为“已验证”。<a title="How do I verify my email address?" href="kb_article.php?ref=5151-RUAS-1543#verify">了解如何验证电子邮件地址</a>。</li>  <li><b>在蒸汽平台设置里启用令牌。</b><br />  登录蒸汽平台客户端之后，您可以通过以下方式启用蒸汽平台令牌：点击客户端左上角的“蒸汽平台”，前往“设置”，再在“帐户”选项卡中选择“管理蒸汽平台令牌帐户安全设置…”。</li>  </ol>  <p>大功告成！随着蒸汽平台令牌的启用，每次您从无法识别的设备上登录蒸汽平台时，都需要输入发送至您电子邮件地址中的特殊验证码。</p>  <p><a name="enablephone"></a></p>  <h4>同时授权的设备数量有没有限制？</h4>  <p>没有任何限制。蒸汽平台令牌旨在保护您的利益，而非限制您访问自己的内容。和以往一样，您可以从任何数量的设备上访问您的蒸汽平台帐户与库。</p>  <p><a name="deauthorize"></a></p>  <h4>如何取消对某台设备的授权？</h4>  <p>取消对一台设备的授权，意味着它将显示为新设备。您下次使用该设备登录时，需要输入蒸汽平台令牌验证码。</p>  <p>如果您在公共电脑上登录时错误地勾选了“记住我”的复选框，或者您的帐户遭到入侵，您应该取消对之前所有受到蒸汽平台令牌保护的计算机的授权。您可以在“<a href="https://store.steamchina.com/account/">帐户明细</a>”页面的“管理蒸汽平台令牌”中选择“取消对其他所有设备的授权”。除您正在执行操作的设备之外，该操作将取消对所有计算机或设备的授权。</p>  <p><a name="code"></a></p>  <h4>要如何收到新的蒸汽平台令牌验证码？</h4>  <p>通过电子邮件：退出蒸汽平台并重新登录帐户。这将会重新生成一封新的验证邮件。</p>  <p>请务必输入所发送或生成的最新验证码，旧的验证码无法进行验证！</p>  <p><a name="email"></a></p>  <h4>我没有收到含有蒸汽平台令牌的邮件，该怎么办？</h4>  <p>请确定您查看的是与您的蒸汽平台帐户相关联的电子邮件收件箱。也许您使用了另外的电子邮件地址？</p>  <p>如果您确实没有收到邮件，请查看垃圾邮件筛选器和垃圾邮件收件箱。</p>  <p>请在您的邮件客户端将“support@steampowered.com”与“noreply@steampowered.com”添加到您的邮件联系人或受信任的发件人名单中，再<a href="#code">请求一个新的验证码</a>。</p>  <p>虽然蒸汽平台能即时发送电子邮件，但是您也可能遇到收件时间延迟的情况。这由电子邮件服务提供商服务器的负载和处理时间决定。如果您在三小时后仍未收到验证邮件，请<a title="蒸汽平台客服" href="https://help.steamchina.com">联系我们</a>。</p>  <p><a name="auth"></a></p>  <h4>为什么每次我登录同一台设备时，都被要求验证此“新设备”？</h4>  <p>这可能与您的浏览器的安全设置有关。如果您网页浏览器的隐私级别设置过高，浏览器将无法储存您的商店（网页） cookie 信息。请检查您的浏览器设置，确保 cookie 已被允许。</p>  <p>运行清除网络历史记录、删除未使用的文件、阻止 cookie 创建或清除孤立注册表项的程序，可能也会导致此问题。禁用这类程序将防止您在通过网页浏览器登录蒸汽平台时再遇到此问题。</p>  <p><a href="kb_article.php?ref=3658-TPXM-3237" title="为什么每次我登录同一台设备时，都被要求验证此新设备">更多信息…</a></p>  <p><a name="cantlogin"></a></p>  <h4>如果蒸汽平台令牌启用后，我不能登录，该怎么办？</h4>  <p>如果需要登录蒸汽平台方面的帮助，请访问 <a href="https://help.steamchina.com">https://help.steamchina.com</a>。</p>  <p><a name="ps3"></a></p>  <h4>蒸汽平台令牌会不会禁止我在需要使用蒸汽平台登录的第三方站点上登录？</h4>  <p>不会。蒸汽平台令牌不会限制您使用自己的蒸汽平台<strong>&nbsp;</strong>帐户凭据通过第三方网站访问自己的蒸汽平台帐户。</p>    <p><a name="stolen"></a></p>    <h4>为什么启用了蒸汽平台令牌的帐户还是会被盗？</h4>  <p>蒸汽平台令牌通过要求您访问经过验证的电子邮箱帐户来保护您的蒸汽平台帐户。此第二层安全防护有赖于您的电子邮件帐户同样安全。以下是用以窃取启用了蒸汽平台令牌的帐户的常见伎俩：</p>  <ol>  <li><b>盗取电子邮件：</b>如果您经过验证的电子邮件地址被盗或入侵，盗号者在知道您的帐户名称后，就能轻易进入您的蒸汽平台帐户。他们并不需要知道您的蒸汽平台帐户密码，因为只要能访问您的电子邮件地址即可重置密码。所以，千万不要为您的蒸汽平台帐户和电子邮件地址使用相同的密码。</li>  <li><b>盗取蒸汽平台令牌相关文件：</b>蒸汽平台绝不会要求您提供任何与蒸汽平台令牌相关的文件。如果您上传或将蒸汽平台令牌的 .SSFN 文件泄露给别的用户，他们就可以无需访问您的电子邮件帐户而直接访问您的蒸汽平台帐户。不过，他们需要知道您的蒸汽平台帐户密码和用户名称，才能使用此文件。</li>  <li><b>恶意软件：</b>盗号者可以通过恶意软件来访问您的计算机，并通过您已授权的设备登录您的帐户。因为您的蒸汽平台帐户已开启，或您已保存了帐户的登录凭据，盗号者不需要知道任何帐户信息就可访问您的帐户。安装带有实时保护功能的正版杀毒软件，避免登录或查看可疑的网页或文件，可以防止恶意软件危害您的系统。</li>  </ol>  <p><a name="notenabled"></a></p>  <h4>为什么蒸汽平台令牌的按钮消失的同时，蒸汽平台会提示“蒸汽平台令牌未启用”？</h4>  <p>在蒸汽平台客服对您的帐户进行恢复后，可能会发生这种情况。如果启用或更改蒸汽平台令牌设置的按钮消失，您必须重启蒸汽平台。</p>  <p>蒸汽平台客户端的设置对话框如下图所示：</p>  <p><img src="http://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/support/faq/chts/sgnotenabled.jpg" alt="蒸汽平台令牌 Not Enabled" style="border:1px solid grey" /></p>',

    "Faq_GetPoints_A1": "You will not receive any points for funding your Steam Wallet or for any Steam Community Market purchases.",
    "Faq_PointsExpire_Q": "Do Steam Points expire?",
    "Faq_PointsExpire_A": "Nope! The Points Shop is here to stay, and open all year around.",
    "Faq_Limits_Q": "In past sales events, some of these items expired after a certain amount of time or had a limited number of uses. Is that still the case?",
    "Faq_Limits_A": "No, all Points Shop items are yours to keep and have unlimited use.",
    "Faq_Trade_Q": "Can I trade or sell the items I get from the Points Shop?",
    "Faq_Trade_A": "No, all items from the Points Shop are associated with your account and cannot be transferred to others.",
    "Faq_TradingCards_Q": "How is this different from Steam Trading Cards?",
    "Faq_TradingCards_A": "Now you can redeem your Steam Points for emoticons and profile backgrounds associated with the games you own. The Steam Points program builds upon the existing Steam Trading Cards features and makes them accessible to more players. In addition to collecting and crafting cards, the Points program now offers another, more direct, way to acquire these emoticons and backgrounds.",
    "Faq_Refund_Q": "What happens to my Steam Points when I refund a game?",
    "Faq_Refund_A": "When you refund a game, the points you gained from that purchase will be deducted from your account. If that causes your Points balance to go negative, we'll also remove the most recent items and Community Awards you've used points for, until your balance is no longer negative.",
    "Faq_Lunar_Q": "I didn't redeem all my tokens in the 2020 Lunar New Year event. What happened to those?",
    "Faq_Lunar_A": "Any points you acquired and did not redeem during our last seasonal event have gone away. But! You have been granted points for any purchases you've made on Steam since the end of the 2020 Lunar New Year event.",
    "Faq_WhatElse_Q": "What else can I use my points for?",
    "Faq_WhatElse_A": "If you don't find anything that you really want in the Points Shop, you can always use your points to grant an award to a user review, showing others how valuable you think that review is. This award will be shown publicly on the review.",
    "Faq_WhatElse_A1": "In a similar fashion, you can also use your points to grant an award to other kinds of user-generated content, including Workshop items, guides, screenshots, and videos.",
    "Faq_WhatElse_A2": "We also plan to expand the set of things you can use your points on in the future.",
    "Faq_SortOrder_Q": "Do Community Awards impact the sort order of content?",
    "Faq_SortOrder_A": "Nope. User generated content posted to Steam is typically ordered by how recent it is or by the number of helpful votes it has received. The number or type of Steam Community Awards applied to a piece of content does not cause that content to appear higher or lower on lists. Though we expect that a piece of content with a bunch of awards may be more likely to catch your eye, and thus may get more helpful ratings indirectly.",
